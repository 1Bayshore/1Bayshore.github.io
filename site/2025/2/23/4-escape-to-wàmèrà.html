     "So what on Tiðloten happened?" Jetla asked Cemili as the carpet they were on continued flying through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cemili sniffled a little. "A lot," she said. "I'm still trying to figure it out myself."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We can help you," Mosile said. "We're here for you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thanks," Cemili said. She took a deep breath. "So two days ago I was in the middle of dinner when I heard a knock at my door. When I opened it there were three people in cloaks standing there wearing xəmri."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's a xəmri?" Flac asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a necklace that shows that they work for the King's Eyes," Cemili said. Flac opened her mouth slightly, and Cemili continued. "They're kind of like the Gold Mountain Group, except they report directly to the King. Anyways, they asked if they could talk to me about something urgent and secret. They seemed to be who they said they were, and were speaking in very formal Quərfi. I let them in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once I'd closed the door, one of them told me that the king needed me to return to Quərfi right away for some urgent task that I couldn't even find out about until I got there. I said no, they insisted, I said no again. They didn't listen. I can't quite remember what happened next, but there was a fight of sorts. The next thing I remember was having a cloak thrown over me, and being dragged off past one of the guys and out into the street. I distinctly remember seeing the guy's cloak had ripped, showing his armour underneath, and he was bleeding. I was taken by carpet back to Quərfi."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What happened to that bleeding guy?" Mosile asked. "Were you armed or something?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I- I'm honestly not sure what happened," Cemili said. "He tried to drag me off, and I think I kicked him in the shins. The next thing I remember, he was across the room like that."
    </p>
    <p>
     Mosile's eyes widened. "You kicked him across the room?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know," Cemili said. She began crying again. "It all happened so fast, and they took me away and I'm not even sure why-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's okay," Mosile said. "We really are here for you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know," Cemili said. She took another deep breath. "So we arrived at my parents' place in the middle of the night. They seemed surprised to see me. The people from the King's Eyes said something about a prophecy, and that my parents needed to make sure I stayed in their place until they returned. My parents locked me in my rooms, and I'd been there until you arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Does that make sense?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you remember exactly what the comment about the prophecy was?" Jetla asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cemili thought for a moment. "The people who brought me said 'It's about the sənā prophecy.' My mother replied 'That's impossible - it would contradict her birth prophecy.' Then the people who brought me said 'Sadr Dgim Krō has made a new discovery.' Then they left."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's a birth prophecy?" Flac asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a prophecy that people in my family get when they are born," Cemili said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's your birth prophecy?" Flac asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nobody knows their own birth prophecy," Cemili said indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry," Flac said. "I was just asking."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I hate to interrupt," Jetla said, "but where are we going?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right now," Cemili said, "we need to make it into Wàmèrà. I don't know what we should do next."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's find a place to stay and we can make a plan this evening," Jetla suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
     They flew on. The snowy mountainside began to have scraggly trees, which became more frequent, and taller. As they descended further, the snow became patchier and eventually disappeared altogether. As the terrain finally levelled out, the trees gave way to pastures where horses were grazing. After a little travel over the pastures, a small cluster of buildings appeared in the distance. Cemili lowered the carpet down towards the ground in one of the pastures and landed, smoothly, on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're in Wàmèrà now," she said. "We need to hide the carpet and continue on foot."
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone stood up and got off the carpet. Cemili picked it up and they walked through the mucky field over to one of the wooden fences. Cemili slid the carpet below the fence and buried it in the mud. They then continued towards the cluster of buildings, their shoes squelching with every step. They passed several brown horses grazing. Soon the cluster of buildings was close in front of them. Cemili walked up to the door of one of them and knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a moment, the door opened. An older man wearing beige looked out at the four friends. He sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What are you here for?" he asked in Wàmèrìʒá.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're looking for a place to stay the night," Cemili answered, also in Wàmèrìʒá. "Do you know if there's an inn nearby?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not for half a day's ride," the man said. "Where are you headed?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "North," Cemili said.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man sighed heavily again. "Well, I suppose that by custom I should offer you a traveller's right of stay. I hope you are okay with my rather crowded house."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We are very grateful," Cemili said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jetla, Mosile, Flac, and Cemili followed the man into the house.
