     Flac, Jetla, and Mosile followed the cloaked woman up a short stairway and through a door into a room with large windows looking out over the floating city on one side. A massive table stood in the middle of the room, covered with a smooth green tablecloth. Around the table there were wooden chairs, with smooth green cushions on them. There was a large bowl of red-orange soup in front of two of the chairs to the left, and in front of three of the chairs to the right. The cloaked woman motioned towards the three chairs on the right as she sat in front of the bowl of soup on the left. "Do take a seat," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jetla, Mosile, and Flac each carefully sat down in front of a bowl of soup. The cloaked woman removed her hood and smiled slightly again. "My apologies," the woman said, "I forgot to introduce myself. I am Sadr Num Kəʒgan, High Priestess of the Qua vrə Həri, and wife of the Minister of Defence Sadr Gno Kəʒgan. You perhaps would know me best as the mother of Sadr Gnosə Kəʒgan."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where is she?" Flac asked. "You promised us we'd see her."
    </p>
    <p>
     "She'll be down shortly," Num said. "In the meantime, please enjoy some sep soup." She took a sip directly from the bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I still don't understand," Flac said. "What happened to Cemi - I mean Sadr Gnosə Kəʒgan?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "All in good time," Num said. She took another sip of the soup. "Now, would you like some bread with your soup? I can request some."
    </p>
    <p>
     A man wearing a cloak, although not a hood, suddenly walked into the room. He had a gilded sword strapped to a belt around his cloak. Num looked up at him. He said something in Quərfi to her, and she replied. She then turned back to the three of them. "Let me introduce my husband, Quərfi Minister of Defence Sadr Gno Kəʒgan."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nice to meet you," Jetla said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you'll excuse us for a second," Gno said, "we need to have a brief discussion."
    </p>
    <p>
     Num and Gno walked over to one of the doors, talking quietly in Quərfi. Jetla listened intently, and after a moment whispered to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think Sadr Num Kəʒgan said she drugged the soup," Jetla said, "and the guy she's talking to wants to hit us on the head with a stick. I might be wrong." Mosile gripped the hilt of her sword tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Num and Gno stepped out of the room, but returned after a moment. Num then returned to her seat, while Gno stood beside the table. Num turned back towards Jetla, Mosile, and Flac and smiled slightly once again. "Please do enjoy some soup," she said. "I would hate for it to go to waste."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then show us Cemi - I mean Sadr Gnosə Kəʒgan!" Flac said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Num sighed. "You will see her soon enough," she said. "Please enjoy some soup while you wait." Flac leaned back in her chair without eating any soup.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gno commented something quietly to Num in Quərfi. He then stepped closer to Jetla, Mosile, and Flac.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Watch out!" Jetla said. She leapt out of her chair and ran around the other side of the table. Mosile drew her sword, while Flac raised her hands and pointed her palms at Gno.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gno cackled. "My job is managing weapons," he said. "Yours are weak." He then drew his gilded sword.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where is Cemili?" Flac demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sadr Gnosə Kəʒgan is safe," Gno answered. "You will see her soon enough."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Give us our friend back!" Flac demanded. A small burst of flame emerged from her hands and flew towards Gno.
    </p>
    <p>
     Num suddenly pulled out a dagger and threw it towards Flac. Flac lifted her right arm and the dagger flew just under it and bounced off the wall, flying back into Num's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gno slashed at Mosile with his sword. She parried, moving her sword towards his lower chest, but he managed to counter-parry and return the attack, forcing Mosile to retreat slightly. Mosile then attacked him on the left side. He managed to deflect it but was forced to retreat himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, Jetla had moved around the table towards Num. Jetla picked up a chair and slammed it into Num, knocking her over onto the floor. Num struggled to get up off the floor, attempting to throw her dagger again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flac sent another small burst of flame from her hands towards Gno. He retreated further, parrying an attack from Mosile as he backed up into a closed door. He reached over for the doorknob and turned it, opening the door a crack.
    </p>
    <p>
     Num shimmied backwards from underneath the chair. Jetla slammed the other chair down on her again. Num's arm was bleeding a bit by this point. Jetla then knocked over the other two chairs beside her on top of Num, who kicked at Jetla and struggled to move the chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, Gno made an attack on Mosile. She parried, and forced Gno backwards through the door. He slammed the door shut, even as Mosile tried to pry it open with her sword.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Num struggled to get out from under the pile of chairs, Jetla called out to the others. "Follow me!" she said. She then ran through the door back to the stairway. The others turned and ran after her, Mosile sheathing her sword again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jetla, Mosile, and Flac ran up the cold stone stairs until they reached another door. Jetla threw the door open and they rushed through into a hallway with green carpeting and many paintings of battles hanging on the walls. "Cemili!" Jetla called out. "Where are you?" There was no response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cemili!" Mosile screamed out. "We're here! Where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly there was a repeated banging sound. Jetla, Mosile, and Flac looked around and suddenly saw that one of the doors was shaking. Jetla grabbed the doorknob and pulled as hard as she could. The door wouldn't open. A muffled voice called out something inaudible from the other side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Watch out!" Flac yelled. Everyone stepped aside as Flac held her hands together. A small bead of fire appeared between her hands and began to grow. When it had nearly filled the space between her hands, she motioned forward. The fireball flew forward and smashed into the door, lighting it and everything nearby on fire. Flac stumbled forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the debris from the door had fallen to the ground, Jetla ran into the smoke filled room. Suddenly, a book flew at her, hitting her in the shoulder. "Cemili?" she called out. "It's Jetla! Where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jetla?" Cemili called out from somewhere in the room. Hurried footsteps became audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cemili!" Jetla called out. "I'm at the-"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly something whizzed by Flac, then Mosile, then Jetla. It then flew back, yanking them backwards and knocking them over. The tight string then flew back forwards, wrapping around the three of them, then backwards again. Mosile struggled to get her sword out from under the ever-increasing wrapped string. The footsteps became louder and suddenly a tall cloaked man stood over Jetla, Mosile, and Flac. He was holding the other end of the string.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Leave my sister alone," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But we're her friends!" Mosile said. The string continued to wind tighter. "We're here to rescue her!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're insane," he said. "I look forward to your deaths."
    </p>
    <p>
     A voice cried out in Quərfi. Cemili hobbled through the door and into the hallway. Her leg had a large scar on it. She yelled something in Quərfi at her brother, who dropped the string and stepped backwards. Cemili pulled out a dagger and cut through the string wrapping Jetla, Mosile, and Flac together. "Follow me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jetla and Mosile jumped up, and Mosile gave Flac a hand to get off the floor. They then ran as fast as Cemili could down the hallway and away from the ever-expanding fire. Cemili then threw open a door beside the hallway and stumbled through it. Jetla, Mosile, and Flac followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The room they entered was full of carpets, stacked on shelves and on the floor. There was a large door on the other side of the room. Cemili sat down on one of the carpets near the centre of the floor. "Sit behind me and hold on!" she said. Jetla, Mosile, and Flac did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cemili grabbed a hold of the sides of the carpet, and it suddenly rose off the ground. She then made a motion and the carpet flew towards the large door, which opened in front of them. They passed through the door out of the tower and into the sky. They sped up faster and faster as they flew around the floating buildings and away from the city. As the city grew distant behind them, Cemili breathed a heavy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can't express how glad I am to see you," she said.
