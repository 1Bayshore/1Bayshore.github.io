     is notable for being significantly more colourful and casual than clothing in the rest of Covtle. Popular clothing items in
     <a href="/2024/11/24/mangátle.html">
      Mangátle
     </a>
     , such as labeavlor (lit. flower skirt), lalabnol tresmantef (approx. very skinny shirt), and lalabnol ave (approx. shawl), are not commonly worn in the rest of Covtle. Many clothing items in Mangátle can be worn both casually and formally. This sometimes confuses and offends travellers from the rest of Covtle.

    <h2>
     History
    </h2>
    <p>
     While remains of fabric has been found in Mangátle dating back to at least -500, Mangátle didn't develop a unique style until the 1700s. During this period, lalabnol ave grew in popularity while remaining unheard of in Glisng. Lalabnol ave became associated with the contrarians at the University of Mangátle by the 1820s, and was parodied in comedies of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The period from 1867 to 1967 saw more uniformity in Mangátle. However, in the late 1900s there was renewed interest in lalabnol ave. By the early 2000s, lalabnol ave had become more common than ever before. Lalabnol tresmantef, originally an underlayer to lalabnol ave, became common as a top layer around this time. Labeavlor also became common around this time. It originated as a ceremonial dress for lacanaval ad tevlor (lit. The Festival of Flowers), but increasingly simple versions made it more and more common as everyday wear.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the Wàmèrì War, clothing unique to Mangátle became very popular with anti-war activists, and was seen as a way to quickly differentiate those from Mangátle (who largely opposed the war) from soldiers and other recent arrivals from Glisng. In the years since, clothing unique to Mangátle has remained popular and has become considered one of the most notable features of the city.

     Specific items of clothing
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Labeavlor
    </h3>
    <p>
     Labeavlor (lit. flower skirt) is a skirt with cloth flowers sewn on. It originated as an item of ceremonial clothing for lacanaval ad tevlor. However it is now considered acceptable attire for all situations. Like all Mangátle-specific clothing, it is not considered to be gendered attire.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Lalabnol ave
    </h3>
    <p>
     Lalabnol ave (aprrox. shawl) is another item of clothing that is popualar in Mangátle but not commonly worn elsewhere in Covtle. It is a loose fitting piece of fabric that wraps around the upper body. It is often dyed with bright colours. While historically it was often worn over a lalabnol tresmantef, today it is commonly worn without an underlayer.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Lalabnol tresmantef
    </h3>
    <p>
     Lalabnol tresmantef (aprrox. very skinny shirt) was originally an underlayer to lalabnol ave, but it is now commonly worn on its own. It is essentially a sleeveless shirt. Like lalabnol ave, it is often dyed with bright colours.

     Attitudes towards Mangátle-specific clothing
    </h2>
    <p>
     While people from Mangátle are often proud of their unique fashion, visitors from the rest of Covtle are often confused by it. This often results in misunderstandings. In particular, people from Mangátle are often seen as being flamboyant and unserious when travelling to the rest of Covtle, while people from the rest of Covtle are often seen as being overly stern and serious when in Mangátle.
