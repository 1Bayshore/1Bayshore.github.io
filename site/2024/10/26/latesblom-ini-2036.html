     <strong>
      Laplutse patlavi latesblom ini an 2036
     </strong>
     (lit. An Act Creating New Ridings in 2036), commonly known as
     <strong>
      Latesblom ini 2036
     </strong>
     (lit. New Ridings 2036) was an act of Lapazadapalavi that modified the boundaries of many ridings in the Wiþi Empire. The act was controversial because of its perceived benefit to the Covtle Ini party, in power at the time.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Background
    </h2>
    <p>
     Laplutse patlavi laplimotemadþenat Wiþi (lit. An Act Creating the Wiþi Empire) is the main constitutional text of the Wiþi Empire. Enacted in 1952, it replaced the older system of guild-based elections with a system of regional ridings. (This had long been a demand of the advocacy group Lañome ad leditlena ad laþmangte (lit. The People's Selection Group).) These new ridings were allocated based on population and geography.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, later population shifts resulted in the ridings no longer being population balenced. This led to two acts that modified the boundries of the ridings, including Laplutse patlavi latesblom ini 1984 and Laplutse patlavi latesblom ini 2001. In 2036 the ridings had not been updated in 35 years and were highly out of proportion to population. Several groups, including Lañome ad leditlena ad laþmangte and Èxvich Grèsent, advocated for creating new ridings. In the 2036 Lapazadapalavi election, the Covtle Ini party promised to revise the ridings in an early act of Lapazadapalavi.

    <h3>
     Number of seats in Grèsent
    </h3>
    <p>
     Despite advocacy by Èxvich Grèsent, the number of seats in Upper Grèsent only increased from 5 to 6, while the number of seats in Lower Grèsent remainder at 2. This left many in Grèsent discouraged, and was considered to be a contributing factor to the 2037

    <h3>
     Removal of controversial rival's seats
    </h3>
    <p>
     The act removed a number of seats that were represented by controversial figures. This included
     <a href="/2024/10/19/mangátle-vewiþ.html">
      Mangátle vewiþ
     </a>
     , which had until recently been represented by
     <a href="/2024/9/9/fentlama-acleð.html">
      Fentlama Acleð
     </a>
     , and Þoriv e lavolotum, which was represented by Ðlendo Advol. Covtle Ini maintained that this was a coincidence, and they were not targeting anyone in particular. However, leaked documents later revealed that this strategy was intentional.
