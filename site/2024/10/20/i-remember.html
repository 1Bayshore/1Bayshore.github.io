     I remember hiding in the loft above the family room, reading a book called "The Wonderful Adventures of King Mēchae of Sudasichas" by the light of the little window. Below me, my parents and my brother Ekchan were arguing. I tried not to listen, but I couldn't help it. Their voices permeated the room.
     <br/>
     "I
     <em>
      am
     </em>
     getting an education!" Ekchan said. "I'm just not going to Agrasichas, that's all."
     <br/>
     "Do you remember Avela?" my mum said. "She was from Mangátle. Do you really want to hang out with people like her?"
     <br/>
     "There are more people in Mangátle than Avela," Ekchan said. "I'm not going to hang out with people like Avela."
     <br/>
     "Ekchan," my dad said, "you're Grèstilsan through and through. You'll feel out of place in Mangátle. People won't like you."
     <br/>
     "Mangátle is a very friendly place," Ekchan said. "I'm sure I'll be fine."
     <br/>
     "You don't understand," my dad said. "They don't like Grèstilsans anywhere in Covtle. They'll always turn you down, they'll never give you the opportunity to shine. They'll look like friends, but when it comes down to it, they'll turn on you at the first opportunity."
     <br/>
     "Not everyone in Mangátle is that bad," Ekchan said. "Besides, I'm not going to be there for the people. I want the best education I can get. I want to help Grèsent reach its former glory again, and the best way I can do that is to study politics at the best school I can."
     <br/>
     "You can get a fine education in Agrasichas," my mum said.
     <br/>
     "Not in politics though," Ekchan said. "Please, just let me go. I'm doing this for our family and for our people."
     <br/>
     There was a pause. "Very well," my dad said. "Be careful out there."
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember how on 12 beni, I stood below the clouds on the platform at the railway station. My brother, dressed proudly in a red buttoned shirt with black pants, stood to my left, next to his trunk. My parents, my aunts and uncles and cousins and everyone else was waiting behind us.
     <br/>
     From our right, off in the distance, smoke began to emerge. As the train got closer, my brother turned to me. "I love you," he said. "I'll be back before you know it."
     <br/>
     "Please don't become weird like Avela," I said.
     <br/>
     "I'll be the same as always," Ekchan said. "Just a bit more skilled."
     <br/>
     Steam enveloped us as the train reached the station. My brother gave final goodbyes to everyone while the porter loaded his trunk onto the train, then stepped up into the carriage. I watched as the train slowly pulled out of the station and disappeared into the distance, leaving the platform as if nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember sitting at my family's table. To my left was my dad. To the right there was an empty chair. On the table there was a small slab of meat, plus several types of cooked vegetables. The only light came from the many candles on the table and around the room. Everyone was silent until my dad spoke.
     <br/>
     "Today, as we celebrate the Day of Fire, I want to take a moment to acknowledge someone who couldn't make it. As you might have heard, my son Ekchan was unable to secure time off from the University of Mangátle to celebrate the Day of Fire. So as we celebrate fire bringing light to our world, let us hope that one day, we will be able to celebrate together again, without hiding who we are."
     <br/>
     After a moment of silence, we began eating. But something felt like it was missing. I wished Ekchan was there.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember how on 2 baðatrepavi, I stood below the bright sun on the platform at the railway station. My family stood beside me, eagerly peering down the tracks into the distance.
     <br/>
     Suddenly smoke began to emerge. Soon the train appeared, and before long it was pulling into the station. Everyone watched eagerly as it came to a stop. One of the doors opened and Ekchan stepped out. He was dressed in all grey. He smiled slightly as he stepped down onto the platform. My mum stepped forward to greet him.
     <br/>
     "Good to see you," Ekchan said.
     <br/>
     "We've missed you so much," my mum said. "You've been gone so long."
     <br/>
     "It has been a while, hasn't it?" Ekchan said.
     <br/>
     The porter brought down his trunk. I took one handle. Ekchan took the other and we began to walk back to our house.
     <br/>
     "You need to tell us more about your experiences," my dad said. "We only got a bit from your letters."
     <br/>
     "There isn't too much to share," Ekchan said. "We studied a lot of lapazadapalavi records."
     <br/>
     "What was the most interesting thing you learned?" my mum asked.
     <br/>
     Ekchan didn't respond for a moment. "I learned that King Zhelhus of Ongrèsent actually started the war with Covtle," he said.
     <br/>
     Everyone, including me, looked shocked. "Surely you don't believe that," my dad said quietly.
     <br/>
     "I've seen the declaration of war itself," Ekchan said. "It's in a museum in Glisng. Anyone can go see it."
     <br/>
     "Glisng?" my mum said. "I thought you were staying in Mangátle."
     <br/>
     "You have to go through Glisng to get to Mangátle, mum," Ekchan said.
     <br/>
     "But going to a museum?" my mum said. "That's more than changing trains."
     <br/>
     "I wanted to confirm that King Zhelhus started the war," Ekchan said.
     <br/>
     My dad looked furious. "We are having a discussion when we get home," he said.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember arriving home in silence. I began to run off to the loft, but my dad ordered me to stay put. "I want to make sure all of my children understand this," he said.
     <br/>
     "There's no point in arguing with facts," Ekchan said.
     <br/>
     "Ekchan," my dad said, "do you realise what they put in those museums in Glisng?"
     <br/>
     "Carefully preserved artefacts from around the world," Ekchan answered.
     <br/>
     "No!" my dad yelled out, slamming his fist on the table. "They killed our people. They desecrated our monuments. Then they put the remains in their museum. It's all lies and slander."
     <br/>
     Everyone stood in silence for a moment. "I'm sorry," Ekchan said. "I'm only trying to know the truth."
     <br/>
     "Then don't go to museums in Glisng," my dad said.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember my brother showing me his notes on what he had learned. His notes were messy, and partially in Adcovtle, but I managed to pick out a few things. What I couldn't read he explained.
     <br/>
     "This is about the basic constitutional laws," Ekchan said. "They were established by the 1952 Wiþi Empire Act, which created the empire as we know it today."
     <br/>
     "I thought they took us over before that," I said.
     <br/>
     "They did," Ekchan said. "The Wiþi Empire Act is what makes us an equal participant."
     <br/>
     I frowned. "Dad says we're not an equal participant. He says that we're still ruled from Covtle."
     <br/>
     Ekchan sighed. "There are some adjustments that could be made to make us more equal."
     <br/>
     "But we still have to hide our celebrations," I said. "They're trying to trick you."
     <br/>
     "You should really come to Mangátle," Ekchan said. "You'd learn a lot."
     <br/>
     "You should really live closer to home," I said.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember waiting at the railway station again, on 12 beni, beside Ekchan. Only my immediate family came out this time to say goodbye. It was quiet. As the train pulled into the station, my dad said something to Ekchan.
     <br/>
     "Don't forget who you are," he said. "We all love you. We look forward to seeing you next spring."
     <br/>
     "I love you too," Ekchan said. "Goodbye." The porter took his trunk and Ekchan stepped onto the train. Soon it was rushing off into the distance again.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember in early spring when my mum returned from town excitedly waving a letter. "It's from Ekchan!" she said. I hurried down from the loft, eager to see what Ekchan had written. He hadn't written for several months.
     <br/>
     We all gathered around my mum, who opened the letter. She read it aloud. "To my family," she began, "I've been contemplating my life, and I have decided on a major change of plans. I'm going to work for a dry goods store in Mangátle. I will not be returning home. I wish you all the best. Sincerely, Ekchan."
     <br/>
     My parents looked at each other and both began to cry.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember boarding the train to Glisng the next day, with a round-trip ticket to Mangátle in my hand. I sat dejectedly at the window, watching the scenery go by but not really caring. My parents sat across from me, discussing what Ekchan could do in our hometown of Lèrtstrès.
     <br/>
     "If he wants to work in dry goods," my mum said, "he could work at our local grocer's. They need someone to handle the dry goods section."
     <br/>
     "I'm not sure it's about dry goods," my dad said.
     <br/>
     "I know," my mum said. "I just want him back at home like it used to be."
     <br/>
     "Me too," my dad said.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember changing trains in the massive Glisng central station. Smoke filled the air as we rushed along the platforms and over the bridge between them. We passed vendors selling newspapers and apples, before quickly climbing onto the train to Mangátle. I remember wondering why anyone would live in such smoke and hustle.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember standing outside an orange-painted door in the rain. My parents were in front of me. The building was made of a white stone. My parents knocked on the door.
     <br/>
     After a moment, the door opened. Ekchan stood inside, holding a candle and wearing an orange and green outfit. He looked at us in a look of surprise and dismay.
     <br/>
     "What are you doing here?" he asked.
     <br/>
     "What are we doing here?" my dad exploded. "You can't just leave us. You're part of our family. We need you at home. Come with us, and we can make this right."
     <br/>
     "I'm not yours," Ekchan said. "You can't decide what to do with me. I live in Mangátle now. I have my own life now. Leave me be." He began to close the door.
     <br/>
     My dad forced the door open. "I'm not leaving," he said. He grabbed Ekchan's arm. "You're coming with us."
     <br/>
     Suddenly a voice came out from behind Ekchan. "Stop right there," it said.
     <br/>
     "Who are you to tell me what to do with my son?" my dad said.
     <br/>
     Avela stepped forward into the candlelight. She was holding a wand in one of her hands, and pointing it directly at my dad. "Leave my boyfriend alone," she said.
     <br/>
     My mum looked at her, and back at Ekchan. "How could you?" she said. "After all we've done for you."
     <br/>
     "She's a better person than you are," Ekchan said. "Now leave."
     <br/>
     My dad slowly let go of Ekchan's arm and backed up. Avela slammed the door. We turned and walked away.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     I remember crying on my mum's shoulder on the train home. "I want my brother back," I said. "I want my brother back."
     <br/>
     "I'm sorry," she said, "but he's gone. Don't you ever leave us."
     <br/>
     "I won't," I assured her.
