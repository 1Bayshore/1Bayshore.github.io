     The
     <strong>
      Xíte Rebellion
     </strong>
     (lit. Fire Rebellion) was a rebellion against the Wiþi Empire in Upper Grèsent. It began in 2037 in Ongrèstilsa, and spread to several other cities in Upper Grèsent. The rebellion was decentralised in nature, and did not have a unified leadership. It was quickly suppressed by the Wiþi Empire.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Background
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Kingdom of Covtle, the predecessor state to the Wiþi Empire, began expanding into Grèsent in 1731 with the conquest of Agrasichas. By 1876, all of Grèsent was controlled by Covtle, either directly or through client states.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1984, the Wiþi Empire reorganised Laplimotem teñe ad Grèsent (lit. The external territory of Grèsent), adding the client state of Lèrtsbon to the territory, renamed Laplimotem teñe ad Grèsent igvli (lit. The external territory of Upper Grèsent), and the clients of Sudasichas and Dokagrolis to a new Laplimotem teñe ad Grèsent agvla (lit. The external territory of Lower Grèsent). This reorganisation gave each plimotem teñe a small number of seats in Lapazadapalavi, although these seats were highly outnumbered by seats representing Covtle.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the period leading up to the rebellion, various groups advocated reform that would increase the representation of Grèsent in Lapazadapalavi. One of these groups, Èvich Grèsent, became increasingly influential, despite attempts to undermine it by various Adcovtle governments. In the 2036 Lapazadapalavi election, the victorious Covtle Ini party promised to revise the ridings in Covtle and Grèsent. In an act commonly known as
     <a href="/2024/10/26/latesblom-ini-2036.html">
      Latesblom ini 2036
     </a>
     , they issued a revision of the ridings that only added one seat in Grèsent. Èvich Grèsent called this "a mockery of our demands".
    </p>
    <h2>
     The rebellion
    </h2>
    <p>
     On 9 atasoli 2037, an unknown individual launched a fireball at Labliatla ad Ongrèstilsa (lit. Office of Ongrèstilsa) in Ongrèsitlsa. Following this, a crowd gathered to watch the building burn. Police were called to disperse the crowd, but were unsuccessful. The crowd then destroyed several other public buildings associated with the Wiþi administration, including the police headquarters and the post office. Magical fire was heavily used in the destruction of the buildings, which later led to the rebellion being named the Xíte Rebellion. When reinforcements arrived, police eventually arrested the majority of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
     News of the rebellion spread to other cities through newspapers condemning the rebellion. Following the news, similar fireball attacks on public buildings took place in Lèrtsfort, Lèrtsbon, and Trèsicha. Ongrèstilsa in particular saw several more sporadic attacks on public buildings and homes of senior officials.
    </p>
    <p>
     As attacks became more frequent, Lapazadapalavi declared a state of emergency in Upper Grèsent. On 1 vlori 2037 they deployed Lapeþmagar ad Agrasichas (lit. non-army of Agrasichas) to assist in protecting public buildings. The last attack occurred on 16 vlori 2037.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Aftermath
    </h2>
    <p>
     2477 people were arrested for involvement with the attacks. Most of the arrests were dropped without charges when no proof could be made of their involvement. Despite lack of evidence of their involvement, Èvich Grèsent was banned for "inciting rebellion against the Wiþi Empire".
