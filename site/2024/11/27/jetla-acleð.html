     Her father King Gno Gəʒe of Quərfi has attempted to have her kidnapped multiple times and returned to the royal court of Quərfi.

    <h2>
     Childhood in Quərfi
    </h2>
    <p>
     Jetla Acleð (not her original name) was born on 5 vlori 2019 in Quərfi. Her birth was announced via a royal proclamation. According to Quərfi tradition, she slept on a floating bed and was not allowed to touch the ground for the first hundred days after her birth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jetla has described her childhood as "lonely". She was not allowed outside the palace except for during official events. She was tutored by Xənē Ʒəli in politics, history, magic, and religion. In an interview with Lelvlai ad Mangátle (lit. The Mangátle Star), Jetla stated that Xənē denied her food and breaks during her 12-hour daily lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the age of 14, after the death of her uncle Kəquaʒ, Jetla was given the title of  Deinoiʔi vrə Xəmar vrə Həri (lit. Prince of Sky Tower). She used her new title to fire her tutor Xənē, which caused controversy within the palace but was agreed to by her father King Gno Gəʒe, on the condition that she request a new tutor. She requested Xənha, a famous author and polyglot. This was seen as an unconventional choice, but her father agreed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Jetla was initially praised for her diligence in her work, she was later accused of neglecting her duties in Xəmar vrə Həri (lit. Sky Tower) in favour of studying languages with Xənha. In his trial, Xənha stated that Jetla had expressed increasing interest in Adcovtle over other languages by age 17.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Escape from Quərfi
    </h2>
    <p>
     On the morning of 15 seci 2039, Jetla was reported missing from her quarters by a servant bringing her breakfast. The city was searched, and Jetla was declared missing.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the afternoon on 16 seci 2039, Jetla was taken into custody in Ʃàbèè. While she was at first charged with illegally importing a flying carpet to Wàmèrà, the charges were dropped on 18 seci 2039 and she was released. She travelled north to
     <a href="/2024/11/24/mangátle.html">

     </a>
     , where she began looking for work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Xənha and several servants were tried for "corrupting the prince". Xənha was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, which he is still serving today.

     , Jetla declared her new name to be Jetla Acleð. After a rejection of support by several higher officials, she eventually moved into Lapaza amarli (lit. The Painted House), a colourful building with a large number of artist squatters. She learned how to paint from several of the artists there.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 2042 Jetla sold Jaþmanda e latasoli (lit. The Jaþmanda and a rainbow) for Z127. This drew greater attention to her art. Her work Lasoli seña Ataglin (lit. The sun over Ataglin) won Lageðba ad lazudba ad latordo ad Mangátle (lit. the University of Mangátle art prize) in 2046.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jetla is generally considered to be part of the Marligli artistic movement. Her works focus on natural scenes and strokes of colour. She rarely includes any human figures in her paintings.
