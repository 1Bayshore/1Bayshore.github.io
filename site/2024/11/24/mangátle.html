      Mangátle
     </strong>
     is a city in southern Covtle. It was founded in 596 by the Mangátle people. Its population is 245339, according to the Wiþi Census of 2045.
    </p>
    <p>
     The city is the southermost city in Covtle, at the foothills of the Cientla mountains. It is known for its vibrant culture, including arts and fashion. Latordo ad Mangátle (lit. The University of Mangátle) is the second-oldest in Covtle, after Latordo ad Glisng (lit. The University of Glisng).
    </p>
    <h2>
     History
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Early history (596-704)
    </h3>
    <p>
     Mangátle was founded in 596 by the Mangátle people. Little is known about the early settlement as written records rare. Archaeological evidence suggest that early Mangátle was a mid-size town with a wall around it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mangátle grew in importance during the 600s, during which it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Mangátle. However, in 704 Queen Tleað of Glisng led a conquest of the Kingdom of Mangátle, which culminated in the sacking of Mangátle. The city was almost entirely destroyed.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Rebuilding and growth (704-1117)
    </h3>
    <p>
     Following the destruction of the settlement, Mangátle was slowly rebuilt. It had reached its former size by 792. During this time, Mangátle was concentrated along the west bank of the Jaþmanda river.
    </p>
    <p>
     During this period, Mangátle and the surrouding areas received newcomers from the area surrounding Glisng. Documents suggest these newcomers were attracted primarily by the warmer weather and resulting longer growing seasons. This increased tensions in the city between the Adcovtle-speaking newcomers and the original inhabitants, resulting in several clashes. However, by the 1100s the population was primarily Adcovtle-speaking.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Founding of the University of Mangátle and the Years of Peace (1117-1274)
    </h3>
    <p>
     In 1117, La njomê asd la tsênat asd la tordosc dosc (modern adcovtle: Lañome ad laþenat ad latordo do) (lit. The Royal Group for a second tower of knowledge) settled on Mangátle as the site for the second Tower of Knowledge, or university. Construction began the same year. The new University of Mangátle began accepting students for the first time in 1125.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new university transformed Mangátle from being primarily a market town to a centre of magic and learning. Some of the items invented in Mangátle in this period were the Necklace of Invisibility, the Floating Cart, and the Shadow Light. Due to high inequality, these items were mostly available to the upper classes.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Quərfi period (1274-1407)
    </h3>
    <p>
     In 1274 the Quərfi, who controlled Wàmèrà at the time, launched an attack on Mangátle and the surrounding region. This first attack was repelled, but after several more attacks, another attack in 1298 succeeded in taking the city. The city was heavily damaged in the attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Quərfi period of Mangátle was marked by a change to a much more militarised city. A new wall was constructed to prevent the city from being retaken by Adcovtle forces. The remains of the Tower of Knowledge were used as a military encampment for Quərfi forces. The non-military population of the city shrunk due to frequent food shortages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Adcovtle forces retook Mangátle briefly from 1366 to 1367. However, Mangátle remained the primary point of Quərfi control in southern Covtle until the Quərfi were completely expelled from Covtle in 1407. Mangátle was almost completely in ruins again by this point.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Rebuilding and growth of the university (1407-1615)
    </h3>
    <p>
     After the Adcovtle recapture of Mangátle, the city was slowly rebuilt. The walls were the first thing to be repaired, with a new strengthened wall built by 1408. Priority was also put on rebuidling the university, which reopened in 1411.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the 1431 Lady Atleva crisis, Lord Caþonlo of Mangátle sided with Lady Atleva rather than with King Jalmu. The creation of lapazadapalavi (lit. parliament) following the crisis allowed for Mangátle to have input, albeit limited to the nobility, in Glisng for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The University of Mangátle became increasingly indepedent from Glisng during this time, and increasingly tied to the patronage of the local nobility. Lord Caþonlo established several programmes at the university which were to be funded in perpetuity by the Lords of Mangátle, rather than by the King.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Population growth and economic prosperity (1615-1720)
    </h3>
    <p>
     The Ice Dragon Winds were very mild in Mangátle, which led to a further influx of farmers to the region from more heavily hit areas looking for warmer temperatures. This in turn led to an increase in artisans and magicians in the city. Between 1615 and 1720, the population of Mangátle is estimated to have increased by 35 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mangátle's role in regional trade also continued to grow. In particular, it became the most important point of import for the Wàmèrìzé spice. Traders from Wàmèrà would in turn purchase magic items produced in Mangátle or further north.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Great fire of Mangátle and aftermath (1720-1730)
    </h3>
    <p>
     In 1720 a fire broke out in a bakery in the south of Mangátle. It quickly became out of control and spread rapidly throughout the city. By the time it was contained over 90 percent of the city had burned. Most of the surviving buildings were in the university, which was built of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fire led to major changes in the city. Many of the most narrow streets were replaced with larger avenues, the most notable of which is Lagan ad larivlé (lit. River Street). A new municipal regulation was passed that required all new buildings to be built of stone. The city was mostly rebuilt by 1730.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Increased autonomy and trade (1730-1867)
    </h3>
    <p>
     In the second half of the 1700s, the city of Mangátle became increasingly autonomous from Glisng. King Emtlanðo (famous for Laþopsona ad elvleda (aprox. Wedensday decree)) granted Mangátle increased autonomy in return for favours from Lord Jalmu. Unlike many of King Emtlanðo's decrees, these were not reversed after King Emtlanðo's abdication and exile, leaving Mangátle fairly prosperous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Adcovtle foreign and military policy during the 1700s and 1800s focused largely on Grèsent. As a result, less money from Glisng arrived in Mangátle. However, trade with Wàmèrà continued to prove prosperous. During this time, the University of Mangátle also became known for its contrarian attitudes towards major issues, leading to academic disputes with the University of Glisng.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Conflict with Glisng and decline (1867-1967)
    </h3>
    <p>
     The 1867 war with Grèsent had a large effect on Mangátle. The central government in Glisng strongly reasserted control, cancelling King Emtlanðo's decrees and demanding the production of weapons. This led to protests from some university faculty and students which were quickly surpressed. Many of those opposed to the war fled to Wàmèrà to avoid being imprisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the war ended in 1876, Mangátle faced high taxation and increased demands from Glisng. Despite some people returning from Wàmèrà following the War of Succession there, Mangátle stagnated. Unemployment was a major problem during this period, with many leaving for work in further north places such as Magþe and Wimþac. The opening of new universities in Vlojtum and Wimþac was particularly detrimental to Mangátle's status as a university city.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Renewal of Mangátle (1967-2019)
    </h3>
    <p>
     In 1967 the secret plant behind the Wàmèrìzé spice was snuck out of Wàmèrà by Çùɲûnù and planted near Mangátle. This led to a renewal of interest in Mangátle and a growth of related economic opportunities. A railway line was connected to Mangátle in 1972. The university was expanded in 1998 following a renewed interest in Mangátle's earlier contrarian scholarship. Lañome ad tesececlohé ad Mangátle (lit. The Student's Society of Mangátle) was established in 2001 to advocate for students in Mangátle. It quickly became controversial for disagreements with the government in Glisng.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Wàmèrì war and protest (2019-2022)
    </h3>
    <p>
     The Wiþi imperial government delcared war on Wàmèrà in 2019. Mangátle was intended to be a base of operations for launching the invasion. However, the war was widely opposed in Mangátle, in particular by the university. Protests against the war, organised by Lañome ad tesececlohé ad Mangátle, were described as "massive" and "sending a powerful message against the war" by Lelvlai ad Mangátle (lit. The Mangátle Star).
    </p>
    <p>
     Many prominent individuals were arrested for participation in illegal protests. These included Vlavin Asoli, a city counsellor of Mangátle at the time, Jetla Admangátle, the head of Lañome ad tesececlohé ad Mangátle, and Bloro Adili, a student who died due to injuries from his arrest. The protests interrupted military operations and were considered a contributing factor to the decision of the Titoþagli party to end the war once elected.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mangátle was damaged twice during the war. The first damage was from a bomb that had been snuck into Lahegar ad Mangátle (lit. the Mangátle barracks) by a Wàmèrì spy. It exploded, killing 15 soldiers. The second damage came from an explosion of gunpowder being delivered to Lehega ad Mangátle through the city by train. It exploded in the north end of the city, levelling 10 buildings and killing 77 people, mostly civilians.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Post-war period (2022-today)
    </h3>
    <p>
     Since 2022, Mangátle has continued to grow in population. Immigration from Wàmèrà has been a significant contributer to Mangátle's population growth. Several more controversies have arisen, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Lapeomvlenet ad tetitoþa ad latordo (lit. The disagreement about university funds)
     </li>
     <li>
      The election of anti-war activist

      to Lapazadapalavi
     </li>
     <li>
      Several disputes between the city government and the government of Covtle
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     In 2044 Mangátle was declared Lajavlu ad lapebac (lit. A city of the future) by Lamom ad Glisng (lit. The News in Glisng), along with Glisng and Wimþac.
    </p>
