    <p>
     A warm sunlight of spring shone down through the tall tulip poplars, reflecting off of the misty air. Oscar slowly tromped through the leaves on the ground, quietly humming. He pushed through a few bushes on the ground and stepped over a fallen log.
    </p>
    <p>
     He continued, beginning to climb a hill. As the hill got higher he came across the top of a rocky cliff. He walked towards the edge, peering over the trees to the valley below. A sea of forest and unkempt meadow spread throughout the valley. High above the valley a bright red creature with red wings soared through the sky. Oscar took his phone from his pocket and snapped a picture of it. As he zoomed in his eyes widened. He quickly made a phone call.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mom?" Oscar cried out into the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it?'' his mom Catherine asked. She was sitting behind a bland metal office desk in a small cubicle in front of a laptop and talking on the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I spotted a dragon!" Oscar exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" Catherine said, suddenly sitting up straighter in her chair. "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm quite positive," Oscar responded, continuing to look out over the valley. "I've got a picture of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Send it to me right away," Catherine said. She opened a word document on her computer and began typing in notes. "Get back to the car at once. This weekend I'm bringing in the team to see if that dragon is a threat or not."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But Mom!" Oscar cried. "The dragon doesn't see me! I'm very far from it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a dragon," Catherine said. "You need to get out of there and not come back until I've got the team out."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I come with the team?" Oscar asked. "It would be so fun! I'd be more than just a monster specialist - I'd be a full-blown dragonslayer!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine smiled slightly. "I guess you can come. But you need to be prepared for what you're getting into. Dragons can be very dangerous, even if they're not hostile. You need to wear all of the equipment that you got for your birthday. Are you in the car yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mom!" Oscar cried, beginning to retrace his steps. "I've been walking there this whole time!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good," Catherine said. "Well, this Saturday, we'll be exploring that valley."
    </p>
    <p>
     That Saturday, Catherine, Oscar, Kirk, Aster, and Solei, piled into the seats of Catherine's old grey pickup truck, slowly bounced up the rocky dirt road. As she drove, Catherine spoke in a weary voice to the rest of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now there, are we all clear on the plan?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're gonna take the little thing," Kirk said, waving his fists before him, "and blow it right outta its mind before it does the same to us!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Catherine said, a hint of frustration in her voice. The truck bumped over another rock in the road. "Does someone else remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We come here today," Solei said in a slow calm voice, "because our destiny calls us forth to seek a Lesser Red-backed Dragon of the Blue Ridge. We must confront the dragon and restore the True Energy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sort of," Catherine said. She turned the truck sharply to continue up the mountainous road. "What specifically are we going to do to the dragon?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're going to collect some fallen-off scales, a bit of its drool, a bit of its scat, and whatever other stuff we come across," Aster said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, but…" Catherine said, trailing off expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm going to become a dragonslayer!" Oscar said excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No!" Catherine said. A branch of a pine tree whacked against the windshield as the truck continued to climb the road. "First we're going to locate the dragon. Then we're going to sneak up on the dragon and sedate it. Then we're going to put an RFID tag on it so we know if it's leaving the valley and causing danger. After that we'll collect some scales and other stuff, but make sure to be out of there before the sedation wears off."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think this plan's askin' for trouble," Kirk said. "I mean, what if the dragon wakes? I think we'd best just blow it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I think tagging it makes sense," Aster said. "A living dragon's a whole lot more valuable than a dead dragon."
    </p>
    <p>
     "When we see the dragon it will become clear," Solei said. "Only then will we know if the dragon must die."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Killing the dragon is a last resort," Catherine said, pulling the truck around another steep curve. "Our goal today is to tag the dragon."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But Mom!" Oscar cried out. "What will I tell people at school? I'm now a 'dragon-tagger'?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a whole lot better than being burnt to a crisp," Catherine said. She pulled the truck up onto a flat spot, slammed the gear shift into park, and pushed in the parking brake. "Now," she said, "we're walking from here."
    </p>
    <p>
     The five of them piled out of the truck onto the rough ground. Kirk put down the tailgate and threw the net off of the equipment, grabbing his backpack with a rifle swung to its side, and a tranquiliser in his hand. Aster grabbed a light backpack which rattled. Solei slowly hoisted a very heavy backpack onto his back. Catherine and Oscar grabbed their identical backpacks, Catherine clipping the keys onto a carabiner on the outside, and they set off hiking through the tulip poplars.
    </p>
    <p>
     After some hiking, Oscar showed them up the hill to the rock overlooking the lush green valley where the dragon had been seen flying before. They scanned the forest and the meadow, looking for the dragon, but couldn't see anything. Aster and Oscar took out binoculars from their bags to look closer and scanned the valley closely. Suddenly Aster jumped in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You spotted the dragon?" Oscar said, jumping with excitement. "Isn't it big?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Even better!" Aster said. "There's a bunch of dragon scales on the ground. I think we found a site where the dragon does grooming!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine took out a compass and a piece of paper with a pencil from her bag. "Where is this exactly? If we don't see the dragon, this is our best sighting."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's right behind the small pond," Aster said, gesturing vaguely with her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I see," Catherine said. She took a sighting with the compass and noted it down on the paper. "I'm going to check one more time for the dragon before we head down there."
    </p>
    <p>
     She scanned the valley with her binoculars again, but didn't see anything. She put them away and, hitching up her backpack, called out, "We're setting off for the spot behind the pond."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We must not travel there!" Solei suddenly cried out. The others all looked back at him. "I sense great danger there! We must confront the dragon where it now sits."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where's that?" Oscar asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know not," Solei responded. "I know only that Red-backed dragons must not be confronted from within their lairs. Many a terrible fate befalls those who do."
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine sighed. "Why didn't you mention this when we were planning?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I could not yet see the true course of our encounter," Solei responded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine looked stumped for a moment. "If we can't see the dragon, and we can't approach evidence of the dragon's habitations, what can we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "If we are truly meant to confront the dragon, it will come to us," Solei said confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Red-backed dragons have a very keen sense of smell," added Aster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine sat down on the ground. "In that case, we will wait here, I guess." She took a journal out of her bag and began taking down notes. Kirk polished off the end of his rifle. Solei looked out at the wispy clouds strung through the sky. Oscar watched out over the valley, daydreaming about slaying a dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the rest of them waited, Aster slowly climbed down one side of the rock, looking at a small pink flower growing in a crack. She peered intently at it, before noticing a few more growing further down the side. She continued to climb downwards to the lower patch, when she suddenly spotted something shiny and red. She grabbed it and held it up to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a dragon scale!" she cried out. "Right here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar began to hurry over. "Be careful!" Catherine yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We should follow up the trail of scales," Aster suggested, climbing down to the base of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes!" Oscar said enthusiastically, beginning to climb down the side of the rock. "Let's go!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Slow down!" Catherine said. "What are you going to do when you reach the dragon?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The same plan as before," Aster said. She stepped carefully over a delicate plant and set off into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll be right behind ya 'cause somethin' might happen," Kirk said, swinging himself over the edge of the rocks and beginning to climb downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine looked ruefully back out over the valley before slowly beginning to climb down the rocks. Kirk jumped the final bit down to the ground and ran up to where Aster was walking through the dense underbrush of wild blackberries and poison ivy, crossing into the leaf-strewn underbrush under the oaks. Oscar followed closely behind, a big grin on his face as he attempted to leap over the thorns. His pant leg got caught on them and he stumbled. Aster and Kirk both looked back towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tread carefully to avoid touching the thorns," advised Aster.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stomp them down firmly," advised Kirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not my mom!" Oscar cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You need to be more careful," Catherine said. Oscar rolled his eyes away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they began to set off into the forest, Catherine looked back. She suddenly realised that Solei was still standing on top of the rock, staring off into the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Solei!" she called. "We're following the dragon's scales through the forest!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh!" Solei cried, suddenly looking down at the others and beginning to walk over towards the side of the rock. "Our journey commences."
    </p>
    <p>
     They continued through the forest slowly, Aster stepping slowly and carefully around the various small plants on the ground, moving very quietly. Her eyes darted across the fallen leaves and rotting logs, spotting where the leaves had been rustled from the ground, the occasional fallen scale. Kirk slowly and precisely moved his tranquiliser from side to side with every noise.
    </p>
    <p>
     The noise of a ferocious rustling suddenly came from the left. Aster stopped looking at the ground and raised her eyes to the left of their path. Kirk raised his tranquiliser and prepared to fire. Catherine turned quickly and firmly towards the noise. Oscar jumped up in a startled excitement. Even Solei stopped absent-mindedly staring off into the distance and turned to look. A large squirrel appeared behind one of the trees, leaping through the forest at high speed.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Catherine gave a sigh of relief, a low thumping sound came from the opposite direction from the squirrel. Suddenly everyone turned to the other side. From behind a large clump of mountain laurel, a large yellow dragon stepped into view. Its scales shimmered, even from under the cover of the leaves of the trees. Its slitted eyes were a bright metallic blue. Its leathery wings stood mostly closed, It opened its mouth for a moment, showing off its teeth and letting out a low sound. It then turned its head towards the party and took a step towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here goes nothin'!" Kirk cried out. He pointed the tranquiliser right at the dragon and pulled the trigger. The dragon lept towards Kirk, growling as a bolt of lightning came from its mouth and zapped the tranquiliser dart out of the air. Kirk backed up, pulling the taser out of his bag. Aster moved to a side position, out of the dragon's path. Oscar pulled out his pepper spray and began to spray towards the dragon from a slight side position. As the dragon continued to advance towards them, Catherine did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Solei looked on at the scene with a face of shock for a moment, before crying out to the rest of them. "We must cease this attack!" he cried out. "This is not the dragon we have come to meet!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a bit late for that now!" Kirk yelled, continuing to retreat as the dragon advanced towards him. He pulled out his taser and a battery from his tool belt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's looks like an Eastern Lightning Dragon!" Aster yelled. "Whatever you do, don't shock it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk had already zapped the dragon with the taser. The dragon suddenly picked up its pace to a run. It opened its mouth again and let out a bellowing sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk tripped over a stump and fell to the ground, the taser and the battery falling out of his hands. He grabbed his rifle as the dragon advanced towards him, and fired a shot that hit the dragon in the side of the mouth. The dragon began to bleed but still reached its mouth down towards Kirk laying on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar suddenly began running towards the dragon's lowered wing. He leapt onto the sturdier bone of the wing and launched himself onto the dragon's back, landing sideways across the dragon's back. As he sneezed in the pepper spray, the dragon snatched the taser battery in its mouth and crunched it to bits. Oscar swung his right leg over the dragon's back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I need a rope!" Oscar cried out. Catherine shuffled through her backpack and quickly pulled out a long nylon rope. She tossed it to Oscar, looking bewildered and concerned. The dragon leaned down towards Kirk again, causing Oscar to slide forward towards the dragon's head. Keeping hold of one end of the rope, Oscar threw the other end around the dragon's head and grabbed it, pulling backwards. The dragon reared upwards as Kirk fired another shot from his rifle and rolled sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the dragon pulled its head down again, Oscar pulled the rope again. The dragon flexed its wings and began to thrash. Kirk rolled over to get out from below the dragon, while Oscar struggled to stay atop the thrashing dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dragon made another pull downwards. It grabbed the taser in its mouth and crushed it to bits. It then suddenly made a pull backwards and began to flap its wings vigorously and rush forwards. Oscar slid onto its left wing, letting go of one end of the rope. As the dragon battered its way through the forest, its wingbeat threw Oscar into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar tried to grab a high tree branch, but the branch snapped and he began to fall quickly towards a stump on the ground. Kirk leapt up from the ground and caught him in his descent. They both fell to the ground on a spot without a stump. The dragon continued to run and slowly began to lift into the air. Aster hurried over to the two of them, carrying a plant with a long stem and broad leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you okay?" she asked Oscar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm fine," Oscar said, grimacing. He pointed to a gash on his arm. "This hurts a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
     "This plant should help," Aster said, handing Oscar the plant. "Rub it on the wound."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thanks," Oscar said. He began to rub it on the wound as instructed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aster then turned to Kirk. "Here's some for you," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm fine," he said, brushing the dirt and leaves off of himself. "Just a few scrapes, nothin' much. But that darn dragon ate my taser, and I'm gonna get back at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's not the plan," Catherine said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I see only darkness and danger down that path," Solei said. "We must not continue to confront the lightning dragon. The dragon would most certainly use its powers of lightning on us, and we would be in grave danger."
    </p>
    <p>
     "This dragon is much more dangerous than the one we came here to tag," Catherine said firmly. "We need to return to town at once and not return until we have a plan for how to deal with this much more serious scenario."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, we need to make sure nobody's seriously injured," Aster said.
    </p>
    <p>
     The group slowly began to trudge back through the woods. After a moment of disappointed silence, Kirk yelled out in an angry voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That damn dragon! I spent seven hundred dollars on that taser!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're lucky we didn't end up worse," Aster said. "We can replace equipment."
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you hadn't been busy pickin' flowers while most of us-" he gestured to Catherine, Oscar, and himself- "were fightin' it off, we would'a still had it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Signs of ill fate were all present," Solei said. "Our punishment was meant as a warning."
    </p>
    <p>
     The group slowly began to trudge back towards the rock. Catherine hung her head down in frustration, while Aster rubbed a leaf on a wound. Kirk cursed the dragon repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So much for being a dragonslayer," Oscar said cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do not fear," Solei said. "You are destined to become one."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Destiny's all good and well," Kirk said, "but what we really need is more guns."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We need to be prepared for the dragon we encounter," Catherine said. "I only brought 2 ropes, and only one with a heat attraction charm."
    </p>
    <p>
     They reached the rock and began to climb back up. About halfway up, Aster picked up a shiny scale and peered at it, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look," she said, holding up the scale so everyone could see it, "this can't be the dragon we saw. This is so clearly red, not yellow."
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine stared down at Aster, eyes squinted and a slight frown on her face. "That would make two dragon species in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Surely someone would have seen them before now."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But that scale looks like the dragon I saw!" Oscar said. "There must be two dragons!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We have not yet confronted our destiny," Solei said. "This is a sign."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's get movin'," Kirk said. "Looks the same to me."
    </p>
    <p>
     As they looked back out over the valley, they saw the dragon soaring over the forests and fields. Its wingbeats were rare but vigorous, and it shone with a glow out from its scales. Oscar pulled out his phone and took a picture, staring out over the valley for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's not the dragon I saw," Oscar said with certainty. He held up his phone and swiped between the two photos. "See the difference?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not sure," Catherine said. "It might just be the lighting."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I'm sure! Don't you see the differences between the scales?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We'll have to come back later," Catherine said. "We need proper equipment." She hoisted up her backpack and turned towards the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We must not leave just yet," Solei said. "We must still confront the Red-backed dragon."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's probably no Red-backed dragon here," Catherine said with exasperation. "I'm not waiting around to find out and potentially confront that other dragon again. The truck is leaving." She began to push through the mountain laurel and descend the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar sighed and followed down the hill, with Aster and Kirk close behind. Solei followed at some distance. As they reached the Tulip poplar forest, Oscar suddenly stopped and cupped his hand around his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it?" Catherine asked, stopping herself. Everyone else also came to a halt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you hear it?" Oscar said. "The sort of purring sound?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine looked puzzled. "No, I don't hear anything. We're nearly back to the truck anyways."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's get movin'," Kirk said, beginning to walk forwards again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar looked around, bewildered, but began to walk forwards again. They continued around a corner towards the point where they had parked the truck. Suddenly Catherine stopped and took a step backwards, wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sitting atop the pickup truck was a small dragon with red scales. It seemed to have spread itself over the bed of the truck. Its head, right over the cab, had its eyes closed. Small wisps of smoke slowly rose from its nostrils every second. Its wings were spread out over the sides of the bed. Its tail hung out of the tailgate down to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My god," Kirk said. "It's another dragon." He took a moment to load some more ammunition into his rifle. "Let's charge!" He pulled out his rifle and, pointing it at the dragon, began to run towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aster suddenly stepped forwards towards the dragon. "Wait! I need to collect a vial of its saliva!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We also need to put the tag on it," Catherine said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine handed Aster the box with the cord. Aster slowly and cautiously approached the dragon, taking care in her steps. Kirk looked back and forth in confusion, before training his gun on the dragon's tail. With a vial in hand, Aster stepped up onto the sideboard and slowly slid the vial below the dragon's drooling mouth. She waited a moment for the vial to fill. As soon as it had filled, she screwed a cap on the vial. She then slowly slid the cable with the box around the dragon's neck and fastened it. She then stepped quickly and quietly down from the sideboard and hurried quickly back to the edge of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dragon shifted its head slightly, and twitched its tail, sending gravel flying at Kirk. He ducked and looked back at everyone else, who was just standing at the edge of the clearing. A look of surprise appeared on his face. "Are ya comin'?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have an idea!" Oscar said. He turned towards Catherine and unclipped the keys from the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine looked at him, her eyes narrowing slightly and a frown coming over her face. "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You'll see," Oscar said excitedly. He pressed the car alarm button.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dragon almost instantly opened its eyes and let out a low, rumbling call. It began to flap its wings vigorously. It clambered a foot onto the cab, leaving a small dent, and then pushed off of the hood to lift into the air. It whacked its tail behind it, hitting out the left headlight, before it soared up into the sky and out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     The group quickly hurried for the truck, dumping their bags into the bed in the back and clambering into their seats and slamming closed the doors. As Catherine put the key in the ignition, she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The car alarm," she said. "What a clever thinker you are, Oscar. You really helped us today. I'd like you to come along from now on as part of our dragon-tagging team."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thanks," Oscar said. "But couldn't we really use a cooler name? Being a dragon-tagger sounds
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     lame."
