    <p>
     A cold November wind blew over the beach. Clouds hung in the sky. Waves lapped at the shore. Dunes of sand rose above the beach. Brightly coloured flowers and green grasses grew along the otherwise sandy dunes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five people with backpacks trudged along the beach. Aster paused, looking excitedly at a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've seen this plant before in Virginia, but it's normally not flowering this early," she commented. "Maybe it's because we're further northâ€¦"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine sighed. "It's not the dragon."
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly Oscar cried out in excitement. "I've found it!" He began to run up the dune, but quickly fell into the sand and began to slide, until he was further back than he had been before. Kirk drew the tranquiliser.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be careful!" Catherine said. "We don't want to frighten it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will, Mom," Oscar said, before standing up and beginning to run up the dune again. "Oh," he said disappointedly. "It's only a pile of rocks. When are we ever going to find this dragon?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have to be patient," Catherine said. "Finding dragons can take time."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But we've been searching for three hours! It was supposed to be living just inland from this beach!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know," Catherine said, "but searching for a dragon takes time."
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly Solei spoke. "The dragon approaches," he repeated in a calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone looked around quickly. Over the lake a speck on the horizon was growing. As it continued to grow, the shape of wings and a body began to take shape. The dragon was a soft yellow, with a bright red stripe down its side. Kirk began to aim the tranquiliser.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm gonna get this one," he said confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does everyone remember the plan?" Catherine asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We take the dragon back to North Carolina where it belongs!" Oscar said excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sort of," Catherine said. The dragon continued to approach. "More specifically?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We restore the True Energy by restoring the Hatteras Dragon to its rightful place," Solei said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But which part are we doing?" Catherine asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're takin' this damn thing outta the sky," Kirk answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you," Catherine said.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dragon was nearly above them by this point. Kirk fired the tranquiliser dart at the dragon. He smiled as the dart landed squarely on target, hitting the dragon directly in the soft chest. The dragon turned to follow along the lakeshore to the east.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where's it going?" Oscar said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine looked a little confused. "We'll have to follow it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Should be landin' in a few moments," Kirk said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's looking like Hatteras Dragon," Aster commented.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fate has dealt us another complication," Solei said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine began to walk along the beach, following the dragon. "Come quickly!" she called out the rest of them. They hurried along the beach to the east. Its wingbeats grew slower and slower as it flew up and down more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dragon flew towards one of the dunes, crashing into the edge of the dune as it came to a rest. The entire group cheered. Then Kirk suddenly looked behind them and yanked out his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get down!" he yelled. "It's another one!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure enough, another yellow dragon with red stripes was barrelling down on them. Kirk sheltered behind a pile of logs, with his rifle pointed out towards the dragon. Catherine, Oscar, and Solei took shelter behind him. Aster, on the other hand, simply stood there with a giant smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Whatcha doin'?" Kirk yelled at Aster. "It's comin' for ya!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a female!" Aster exclaimed with excitement. "Maybe they're a mating pair!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's worse!" Kirk said. "We'd best shoot it before it finds out about what we did!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We can't! Hatteras Dragons are a protected species!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They also breathe fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The dragon swooped down and landed just behind the dune. It nuzzled the other dragon, which lay there limply. It then let out a bellowing roar of flames, lighting a few nearby pine trees on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We have displeased the dragon," Solei said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aster ceased gazing at the dragon in awe, and finally ran back to take the shelter behind Kirk. The other dragon took off again and began to fly out over the lake. Aster quickly began to climb up the dune. When she reached the top, she let out what was almost a scream of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a nest! These dragons are nesting!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar began running up the dune, slipping down it again. "I want to see the nest!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," Catherine said, "this certainly changes the plan. How are we going to transport both dragons, plus the eggs?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do not fear," Solei said. "We are destined to succeed."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar eventually reached the top of the dune, and looked down onto the nest. There were three sand-coloured eggs, nestled in the sand. Aster was looking at them, her face full of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can't believe it!" she said. "A dragon's nest! I've never seen one of these before!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'd watch out," Kirk said. "The dragon might be comin' back."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar attempted to lift up one of the eggs. He managed to roll it over, but otherwise didn't move it. "The eggs are super heavy," he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly a loud roar came from behind them. Aster and Oscar both turned to see the dragon barrelling down towards them. Aster ran down the dune and back into the woods, and Oscar tried to roll down the hill, crashing into the tranquilised dragon. As the female dragon approached him, Oscar squeezed himself tightly against the tranquilised dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The female dragon landed back on top of the nest. It settled onto the nest and let out a snort of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oscar!" Catherine called out. "Get down here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "But Mom!" Oscar called out. "I have an idea on how to catch it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar reached into his backpack. He pulled out a rope and placed it on top of the tranquilised dragon's head. Unfortunately, just then the other dragon decided to nuzzle the tranquilised dragon again. It lit the rope on fire. Oscar bolted, falling his way down the dune to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It almost worked!" Oscar said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't even see what you were trying to do," Catherine said. "We'd better get going before things around here get worse. I'm calling the helicopter to tell them that it didn't work."
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine picked up the phone and dialled a number. After a moment she began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello?" she said. "I wanted to let you know that things aren't going according to plan. There are actually two dragons, and a nest."
    </p>
    <p>
     While Catherine was talking on the phone, Kirk left from behind the barricade to slowly climb up the dune, his rifle in one hand and the tranquiliser in the other. He stepped firmly as he approached the now-resting dragon and aimed the tranquiliser. He fired and hit it right in the soft spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, a throbbing sound began to become audible. Everyone except Catherine looked up. A helicopter appeared over the lake, approaching with a large net below it. It lowered below the dragons before hovering in the sky above the site of the two dragons.
    </p>
    <p>
     Juan, the person on the helicopter that was not the pilot Arthur, yelled down over the noise of the rotors to Krik, who was standing most clearly in view. "You said one dragon, not two!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We found two!" Kirk yelled back. "That's whatcha got."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We can only take one," Juan yelled back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take the first," Kirk said. "We'll deal with the second."
    </p>
    <p>
     As the helicopter lowered down the net to lift up one of the dragons, Catherine, Oscar, and Solei emerged from the woods. They stared at the second dragon, stumped.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How are we going to get it home?" Catherine asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got'n idea," Kirk said. "We'll take its eggs. Then it'll leave."
    </p>
    <p>
     "They're super heavy," Oscar said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can lift 'em," Kirk said confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll help," Oscar said.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two of them trudged up the dune, Catherine and Solei looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I sense an ill wind with this plan," Solei said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's the only one we have," Catherine said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before long Kirk and Oscar came down the dune, carrying one of the eggs between the two of them. Kirk and Oscar continued down the beach and back to the truck, where they placed the egg in the back. Before long they had transported all of the eggs back to the truck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine dived back into the woods, looking for Aster. Sure enough, she was bent over a small plant that was growing at the base of one of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've never seen anything like this!" she said excitedly. "It must be one of the rare plants they have here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're heading out," Catherine said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh," Aster said. She took out her phone and took several more pictures of the plant. "I'll look at it later."
    </p>
    <p>
     The two of them left and walked back to the truck, Aster staring at the photos of the plant on her phone. "I believe that it could be some sort of thistle."
    </p>
    <p>
     They loaded into the truck and Catherine began to drive. Aster continued to look excitedly at the pictures of the plant. "Maybe it's the rare Pitcher's Thistle!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you have any ideas about the dragon?" Catherine asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, lots!" Aster said excitedly. "So, Hatteras dragons normally nest slightly inland from the shore. They are some of the fastest fledging dragons. They are out of the nest and flying in just 13 to 15 days. Unlike some dragons, they rely much less on their parents for-" She paused, suddenly noticing the road sign. "Indiana Toll Road? Where are we going?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "North Carolina," Kirk said. "We're bringin' back the eggs."
    </p>
    <p>
     Aster looked back at the back of the truck, horrified. "You can't do that!" she practically screamed. "They'll never hatch!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And we'll be done with our job!" Kirk retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This is unacceptable!" Aster said. "We need to turn back at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly a big thumping shook the car. Everyone looked around. Then Oscar almost screamed. "One of the eggs is hatching!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I told you this was a terrible idea!" Aster yelled back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine activated the hazard lights and began to slow down the truck. Another thump hit the car. Everyone except Catherine looked back at the eggs. There were two big cracks in one of them now. Catherine pulled off into the shoulder of the road and came to a slow stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aster practically jumped out the truck and rushed to the back. She lowered the tailgate and managed to lift the hatching egg, before it slipped from her grasp and fell to the ground. As she looked on, horrified, a tiny dragon emerged from the egg. It fluttered its tiny wings and made a soft sound.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's so cute!" Aster exclaimed, as the rest of the team emerged from the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We've got to do something!" Oscar yelled over the road noise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirk pulled out the tranquiliser from the back of the car and aimed it at the tiny dragon. Aster screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! Stop! It's tiny! A normal dose could kill it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Calm down," Catherine said loudly but clearly over the din. "We need a plan."
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone stood in silence for a moment. Cars rushed by on the interstate, filling the silence between them with a lot of noise. Then suddenly, Oscar smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got an idea!" he exclaimed over the noise of the traffic. "Let's put the dragons back!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Great idea!" Aster said. Catherine stared at him, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why would that help?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar said something to her that got lost in the noise of the traffic. Catherine nodded her head in understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, does everyone understand the plan?" Catherine asked the rest of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We just blow it," Kirk said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No!" Catherine and Aster said at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We must restore the True Energy by returning these dragons to where they came," Solei answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Close enough," Catherine said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar attempted to lift the dragon back into the back of the pickup. Aster bent down to help him and together they lifted the dragon into the back. Aster closed the tailgate and they loaded back into the truck.
    </p>
    <p>
     After checking that everyone was buckled up, Catherine pulled back onto the highway. She drove slowly, checking frequently in the rearview mirror to make sure that the baby dragon hadn't fallen out of the back. It continued to sit, seemingly helpless, in the back of the truck. Catherine took the next exit, taking the opportunity to turn around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before long, they were pulling back into the parking lot near the dunes where they had started. Aster and Oscar took an egg and transported it back up to the nest next to the sleeping dragon. They repeated the process with the next egg, and finally for the baby dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they had moved the dragons back to the nest, they got back into the truck. Catherine started it and they drove off again. Before long they were cruising down the highway again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oscar," she asked once they were on the highway again, "could you make a phone call for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, Mom," Oscar said. "Who do you want me to call?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The National Park Service," she said. "Just let them know that the dragons will be gone in about 13 to 15 days. And let them know we'll give them a 25% discount - per dragon removed."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oscar smiled. "Got it, Mom."
