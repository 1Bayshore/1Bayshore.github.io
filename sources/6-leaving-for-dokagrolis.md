Jetla, Mosile, Flac, and Cemili lay on the bed, looking up at the ceiling. They hadn't noticed until now, but the ceiling was intricately painted with images of Atlanu birds flying and landing on twigs.

"Where are we going tomorrow?" Mosile asked.

"I don't know," Cemili said. "We know so little about what's going on. I don't even know why I was taken back to Quərfi, or what their goals were. I don't think it's safe to go back to Mangátle, but I also don't know where we could go instead."

"You mentioned something called the sənā prophecy," Mosile said. "What was that about?"

"I'm not sure," Cemili said. "I was never interested in prophecies, and given the secretive nature of many of them, I don't know much about them."

"Well, it's not like I believe in prophecies," Mosile said. "But you also said that there was someone named Sadr Dgim Krō who knew something about this supposed prophecy?"

"It's not safe to go back to Quərfi," Cemili said, a little more forcefully.

"But where should we go instead?" Mosile asked.

"Dokagrolis," Jetla said. "There are lots of people there who specialise in fortune-telling."

"They don't even worship the same gods," Mosile said. "Although, historically speaking, it can be argued that-"

"Prophecies still work the same way," Flac said.

"So you do believe in prophecies?" Mosile asked.

"Not the way they're normally described," Flac said. "But the basics of a prophecy should be the same. Prophecies can't see future events, but they can see the flow of magic in the future. This can then be used to estimate events, especially ones that involve large amounts of magic."

"Can you make sense of prophecies then?" Mosile asked.

"Unfortunately," Flac said, "that's like the only magic I haven't done too much of. I just know how it works."

"I'm sure someone in Dokagrolis can help us with this," Jetla said. "Besides, it's not the first place our pursuers would think that we'd be going."

"I agree with Jetla," Cemili said. "At the very worst, it gets us out of harm's way."

"If you're sure about this prophecy thing," Mosile said.

"Let's discuss it more in the morning," Jetla said. "I'm getting a bit tired."

All of the friends slept soundly that night. Mosile was the first to wake up. She could already smell something cooking in the other room. She got out of bed, waking Flac in the process, and the two of them headed over into the other room. Télînàdà was cooking another soup on the stove. He smiled as Mosile and Flac entered the room.

"Good morning," he said. "Did you sleep well?"

"Really well," Mosile said.

"Breakfast should hopefully be ready soon," Télînàdà said. "Feel free to relax until then."

"I can help if you'd like," Mosile offered.

"Oh, there's no need," Télînàdà said.

Flac sat down in one of the chairs. Mosile remained standing. "I hadn't noticed the painted ceiling in the other room earlier," she said. "It's really beautiful. Did you paint it?"

Télînàdà sighed. "It was my wife, actually," he said. "She was a wonderful painter."

"I'm sorry," Mosile said.

"It's okay," Télînàdà said. "Feel free to relax. I'll have breakfast ready soon."

Mosile walked over to the table and sat down next to Flac. She sniffled a little.

"Is everything alright?" Flac asked in Adcovtle.

"Télînàdà's wife was a painter," Mosile said, crying a bit. "Like my mum Jepa."

"I'm sorry," Flac said. She offered her hand and Mosile took it.

Mosile continued softly crying. "I was so little," she said. "And she was such a cheerful person."

She took a moment to wipe away her tears. "I should write to my mum Natla," she said. "Just to let her know that we're alright. We can post it as soon as we pass through a town."

Cemili and Jetla came in from the other room. "Good morning," Cemili said.

"Good morning," Mosile said.

Télînàdà brought the soup over to the table. "I hope that you enjoy the soup," he said.

"It looks delicious," Jetla said.

The four friends started eating the soup. As they ate, Cemili asked the others a question in Adcovtle.

"These people have been so kind to us," she said. "Do you think we should give them a gift?"

"I think it could be nice," Jetla said. "Was there something that you were thinking of in particular?"

Flac sighed an exaggerated sigh. "Unless you want me to repaint their house orange, I'm not sure what you think I could give them."

"I'm not suggesting you have to pay for the gift," Cemili said. "I have a rope of extreme strength. Would that make a good gift?"

"That could be a nice gift," Jetla said. "Does everyone else think that would be a good idea?"

"I think so," Mosile said.

"Makes sense enough," Flac said.

Cemili got up and walked over to the other room. She returned holding the rope of extreme strength and walked over to Télînàdà. "I wanted to offer you and your family a gift," she said in Wàmèrìʒá, holding out the rope.

"Oh," Télînàdà said. "It's very generous of you, but there's no need. We are happy to host you."

"Very well," Cemili said. She returned to the other room, where she placed the rope in the corner. She then returned to the others.

Once they had finished their breakfast, they gathered their limited belongings. Stélìzà and Klàʝíídá arrived, with Kàlàdà and Ãnòwì following a little later. As the four friends prepared to leave, Cemili spoke to the family.

"We wanted to thank you so much for hosting us," she said. "Your kindness is unmatched."

"We are honoured to have you as our guests," Stélìzà said. He even seemed to smile a little.

"We wish you a good year," Cemili said.

"We wish you safe travels," Stélìzà said. "Maybe we will meet again someday."

"Goodbye," the four friends said.

"Goodbye," everyone in the family said.

Jetla opened the door and began to head out. Then suddenly, Ãnòwì ran over to Mosile and grabbed her leg. "I want Mosile to stay\!" she said.

Télînàdà headed over to Ãnòwì. "Ãnòwì," he said, "we have to let our guests leave now."

"I want another story\!" Ãnòwì said.

"I'll tell you a story," Télînàdà said. "But we have to let our guests leave. Let go and say goodbye to Mosile."

Ãnòwì slowly let go of Mosile's leg. "Bye," she said.

Mosile smiled down at Ãnòwì. "Bye," she said.

The four friends headed out the door. They walked back over to the road and began walking north. The sky was clear, and the day was warm for winter. An Atlanu bird flew by them. Mosile sniffled a little bit.

"I'm sorry," Flac said. "But we've got to plan ahead. We're heading straight through Sudasichas. Nothing crazy ever happened in Sudasichas, right?" Everyone laughed.

"Let's just hope nothing crazy happens to us," Mosile said, smiling.
