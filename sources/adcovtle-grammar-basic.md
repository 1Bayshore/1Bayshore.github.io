Grammar:  
Verb tenses:
|Prefix| Tense |
| :---- | :---- |
| ð- (or þ-) | Future (absolute) |
| b- (or p-) | Present (absolute) |
| d- (or t-) | Past (absolute) |
| ðoz- | Future (relative) |
| ps- | Present (relative) |
| doh- | Past (relative) |

Prefixes may be stacked. (e.g. tlano (forbidden) -> atlano (to forbid) -> ma psatlano (I forbid))

Irregular verbs:
* Some verbs are considered «þepete verbs». With these verbs, þ-, p-, and t- prefixes are used in the absolute forms instead of ð-, -b, and d-.
* For verbs that begin with a consonant in the infinitive, remove the final vowel, and put it at the front. (e.g. «hove» -> «ma behov»)
* The only other irregular verbs are «ote», which shortens to «od» in the absolute, and «uzeþ», which shortens to «uz» in the absolute.

Noun Prefix Usage:
* Counted Nouns: Use the prefix la- (attached directly to the noun, e.g., laplimotem). If the word begins with a vowel, the prefix is shortened to just l-
* Uncounted Nouns: Use the prefix te- (also attached directly, e.g., telograði). if the word begins with a vowel, the prefix is shorted to just t-

Make sure the prefixes form one word with the noun (e.g., “laplimotem” rather than “la plimotem”).

Adjectives, adverbs, other modifiers:

* Always after item modified (e.g. noun adjective adverb), except counts of counted nouns (e.g. count noun adjective adverb)  
* Never modified to match noun
* No articles (like English a, the)

Pronouns:

| Adcovtle | English |
| :---- | :---- |
| ma | I/me |
| va | you (singular) |
| ðo | he/him/she/her/it |
| ri | we/us |
| atle | you (plural) |
| co | they/them |

Distinction between subject and object is formed by word order.

Possessives are formed like this: (object) ad (possessor). If the object is obvious, can be shortened to ðo ad (possessor) or to ðedma, ðedva, ðaðo, ðeco

Sentence Construction:

* Subject Verb Object order  
* Voice construction:  
  * At beginning of sentence, add:

| Adcovtle | Meaning |
| :---- | :---- |
| are* | active |
| po* | passive, declarative |
| so | question |
| na | negative |
| iz | conditional (if first statement, then second statement) * Note: when first statement in past, usage more similar to «because first statement, second statement.» |
| þi* | often, subjunctive (not required but almost always used) |

The items marked with asterisks («are», «po», and «þi») are optional and often ommitted except in formal language. In the imperative, «are» is always present. «so», «na», and «iz» are mandatory.

* Question formulation:  
  * Begin with «so»  
  * If answer is direct or indirect object: Leave out or put in the type of noun desired (if unclear)  
  * If answer is subject: Use «vi» as subject
