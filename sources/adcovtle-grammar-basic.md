Grammar:  
Verb tenses:
|Prefix| Tense |
| :---- | :---- |
| ð- (or þ-) | Future (absolute) |
| b- (or p-) | Present (absolute) |
| d- (or t-) | Past (absolute) |
| ðoz- | Future (relative) |
| ps- | Present (relative) |
| doh- | Past (relative) |

Note: Some verbs are considered «þepete verbs». With these verbs, þ-, p-, and t- prefixes are used in the absolute forms instead of ð-,   
Note: For verbs that begin with a consonant in the infinitive, remove the final vowel, and put it at the front.

Noun Prefix Usage:
	•	Counted Nouns: Use the prefix la- (attached directly to the noun, e.g., laplimotem). If the word begins with a vowel, the prefix is shortened to just l-
	•	Uncounted Nouns: Use the prefix te- (also attached directly, e.g., telograði). if the word begins with a vowel, the prefix is shorted to just t-

Make sure the prefixes form one word with the noun (e.g., “laplimotem” rather than “la plimotem”).

Adjectives, adverbs, other modifiers:

* Always after item modified (e.g. noun adjective adverb), except counts of counted nouns (e.g. count noun adjective adverb)  
* Never modified to match noun

| va | you (singular) |
| ðo | he/him/she/her/it |
| ri | we/us |
