Grammar:  
Verb tenses:
|Prefix| Tense |
| :---- | :---- |

| b- (or p-) | Present (absolute) |
| d- (or t-) | Past (absolute) |
| ðoz- | Future (relative) |
| ps- | Present (relative) |
| doh- | Past (relative) |

Note: Some verbs are considered «þepete verbs». With these verbs, þ-, p-, and t- prefixes are used in the absolute forms instead of ð-,   
Note: For verbs that begin with a consonant in the infinitive, remove the final vowel, and put it at the front.

Nouns:

| Prefix | Association |
| :---- | :---- |
| la- (l- if word begins with vowel) | Counted (without specified number, assumed one) |
| te- (t- if word begins with vowel) | Uncounted |

Adjectives, adverbs, other modifiers:

* Always after item modified (e.g. noun adjective adverb), except counts of counted nouns (e.g. count noun adjective adverb)  
* Never modified to match noun
