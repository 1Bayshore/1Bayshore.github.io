## History
### Early history (596-704)
Mangátle was founded in 596 by the Mangátle people. Little is known about the early settlement as written records rare. Archaeological evidence suggest that early Mangátle was a mid-size town with a wall around it.

Mangátle grew in importance during the 600s, during which it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Mangátle. However, in 704 Queen Tleað of Glisng led a conquest of the Kingdom of Mangátle, which culminated in the sacking of Mangátle. The city was almost entirely destroyed.

### Rebuilding and growth (704-1117)
Following the destruction of the settlement, Mangátle was slowly rebuilt. It had reached its former size by 792. During this time, Mangátle was concentrated along the west bank of the Jaþmanda river.

During this period, Mangátle and the surrouding areas received newcomers from the area surrounding Glisng. Documents suggest these newcomers were attracted primarily by the warmer weather and resulting longer growing seasons. This increased tensions in the city between the Adcovtle-speaking newcomers and the original inhabitants, resulting in several clashes. However, by the 1100s the population was primarily Adcovtle-speaking.

### Founding of the University of Mangátle and the Years of Peace (1117-1274)
In 1117, La njomê asd la tsênat asd la tordosc dosc (modern adcovtle: Lañome ad laþenat ad latordo do) (lit. The Royal Group for a second tower of knowledge) settled on Mangátle as the site for the second Tower of Knowledge, or university. Construction began the same year. The new University of Mangátle began accepting students for the first time in 1125.

The new university transformed Mangátle from being primarily a market town to a centre of magic and learning. Some of the items invented in Mangátle in this period were the Necklace of Invisibility, the Floating Cart, and the Shadow Light. Due to high inequality, these items were mostly available to the upper classes.

### Quərfi period (1274-1407)
In 1274 the Quərfi, who controlled Wàmèrà at the time, launched an attack on Mangátle and the surrounding region. This first attack was repelled, but after several more attacks, another attack in 1298 succeeded in taking the city. The city was heavily damaged in the attacks.

The Quərfi period of Mangátle was marked by a change to a much more militarised city. A new wall was constructed to prevent the city from being retaken by Adcovtle forces. The remains of the Tower of Knowledge were used as a military encampment for Quərfi forces. The non-military population of the city shrunk due to frequent food shortages.

Adcovtle forces retook Mangátle briefly from 1366 to 1367. However, Mangátle remained the primary point of Quərfi control in southern Covtle until the Quərfi were completely expelled from Covtle in 1407. Mangátle was almost completely in ruins again by this point.

### Rebuilding and growth of the university (1407-1615)
After the Adcovtle recapture of Mangátle, the city was slowly rebuilt. The walls were the first thing to be repaired, with a new strengthened wall built by 1408. Priority was also put on rebuidling the university, which reopened in 1411.

In the 1431 Lady Atleva crisis, Lord Caþonlo of Mangátle sided with Lady Atleva rather than with King Jalmu. The creation of lapazadapalavi (lit. parliament) following the crisis allowed for Mangátle to have input, albeit limited to the nobility, in Glisng for the first time.

The University of Mangátle became increasingly indepedent from Glisng during this time, and increasingly tied to the patronage of the local nobility. Lord Caþonlo established several programmes at the university which were to be funded in perpetuity by the Lords of Mangátle, rather than by the King.

### Population growth and economic prosperity (1615-1720)
The Ice Dragon Winds were very mild in Mangátle, which led to a further influx of farmers to the region from more heavily hit areas looking for warmer temperatures. This in turn led to an increase in artisans and magicians in the city. Between 1615 and 1720, the population of Mangátle is estimated to have increased by 35 percent.

Mangátle's role in regional trade also continued to grow. In particular, it became the most important point of import for the Wàmèrìzé spice. Traders from Wàmèrà would in turn purchase magic items produced in Mangátle or further north.

### Great fire of Mangátle and aftermath (1720-1730)
In 1720 a fire broke out in a bakery in the south of Mangátle. It quickly became out of control and spread rapidly throughout the city. By the time it was contained over 90 percent of the city had burned. Most of the surviving buildings were in the university, which was built of stone.

The fire led to major changes in the city. Many of the most narrow streets were replaced with larger avenues, the most notable of which is Lagan ad larivlé (lit. River Street). A new municipal regulation was passed that required all new buildings to be built of stone. The city was mostly rebuilt by 1730.

### Increased autonomy and trade (1730-1867)
In the second half of the 1700s, the city of Mangátle became increasingly autonomous from Glisng. King Emtlanðo (famous for Laþopsona ad elvleda (aprox. Wedensday decree)) granted Mangátle increased autonomy in return for favours from Lord Jalmu. Unlike many of King Emtlanðo's decrees, these were not reversed after King Emtlanðo's abdication and exile, leaving Mangátle fairly prosperous.

Adcovtle foreign and military policy during the 1700s and 1800s focused largely on Grèsent. As a result, less money from Glisng arrived in Mangátle. However, trade with Wàmèrà continued to prove prosperous. During this time, the University of Mangátle also became known for its contrarian attitudes towards major issues, leading to academic disputes with the University of Glisng.

### Conflict with Glisng and decline (1867-1967)
The 1867 war with Grèsent had a large effect on Mangátle. The central government in Glisng strongly reasserted control, cancelling King Emtlanðo's decrees and demanding the production of weapons. This led to protests from some university faculty and students which were quickly surpressed. Many of those opposed to the war fled to Wàmèrà to avoid being imprisoned.

After the war ended in 1876, Mangátle faced high taxation and increased demands from Glisng.
