## History
Mangátle was founded in 596 by the Mangátle people. Little is known about the early settlement as written records rare. Archaeological evidence suggest that early Mangátle was a mid-size town with a wall around it.

Mangátle grew in importance during the 600s, during which it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Mangátle. However, in 704 Queen Tleað of Glisng led a conquest of the Kingdom of Mangátle, which culminated in the sacking of Mangátle. The city was almost entirely destroyed.
