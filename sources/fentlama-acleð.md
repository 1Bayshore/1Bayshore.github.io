**Fentlama Acleð** is an Adcovtle politician and former railway worker who served as the Member of Parliament from Mangátle awiþ from 2033 to her resignation in 2034. She is best known for refusing to serve dinner to the elder Lord Espa Adnorbuj on his return trip from his Ma dabevlat laþodgo vla coþle (lit. I did everything right) speech.
## Early Life
Fentlama Acleð was born in 2007 in Glisng. Both of her parents worked for Tevaðon Adcovtle (Adcovlte Railways), her mother as a guard and her father as an engineer. She has one older brother, who served in Lapeþmagar Admangátle (lit. Non-army of Mangátle). She has described her childhood as "hard, but loving". She moved around a lot in her childhood, living everywhere from Voanter to Consada.

At the age of 18, she began working as a waitress for the dining cars on various routes within the Wiþi Empire.
## Espa Adnorbuj Incident
On 20 losi 2032, while working as a waitress on the Mangátle remta, she was assigned to serve Lord Espa Adnorbuj. According to her initial account of the incident, Lord Espa Adnorbuj rudely demanded that she swear allegiance to him, and she refused and refused to serve him afterwards. However, in later commentary she suggested that it might have been unprovoked: "I hated him for his reckless endangering of my brother and other civilians. He was rude, but if I'm honest that wasn't my primary motivation." Lord Espa Adnorbuj maintained to his death that he had simply attempted to order tea. All parties agree that Lord Espa Adnorbuj was served no tea between Mangátle and Glisng.
## Aftermath
When Fentlama's supervisor learned of the incident, he summoned her to explain herself. He fired her at the end of the meeting.

Lord Espa Adnorbuj spoke to several reporters in Glisng about the incident. A reporter from Lelvlai ad Mangátle (lit. The star of Mangátle) requested and received an interview with Fentlama. The interview was published the following day, 22 losi 2032.

Following the publication of the interview, Fentlama was invited to give a speech by the Lañome ad tesececlohé ad Mangátle (lit. the Student's Society of Magátle) for her "bravery in denouncing the evil actions of Espa Adnorbuj". She spoke on 2 atasoli 2032, in a speech that was described as "an eloquent denunciation of the evils of the Wàmèrì War" by a correspondent for Lelvlai ad Mangátle.

After her speech, Fentlama was hired by Lañome ad tesececlohé ad Mangátle to do food service. She continued to work in food service until her election as a Member of Parliament.
## Political Career
In the 2033 Lapazadapalavi election, Fentlama stood for election in the Mangátle awiþ riding as an independent. She was widely considered to be unelectable due to her stance against Lord Espa Adnorbuj. However, after her opponents made a series of perceived blunders, she was elected with 44% of the vote. She assumed office on 12 gerongi 2033.

Fentlama was considered one of the most controversial members of parliament. In her first speech to Lapazadapalavi, she criticised military spending. She voted against the vast majority of bills in the session.
## "Traitor" Comments and Resignation
On 9 baðatrepavi 2034, Fentlama made a statement in Lapazadapalavi in honour of Baðatrepava's birthday, where she criticised the Wàmèrì war. In the criticism of the Wàmèrì war, she called Lord Espa Adnorbuj a "traitor" for his actions. Following this, a near universal vote to censure her passed. She resigned the following day, with a statement to Lelvlai ad Mangátle that "It is clear to me that Lapazadapalavi does not care about the lives of others, only about protecting their position of power."

As of 2047, Fentlama works in food service for Lañome ad tesececlohé ad Mangátle.
## Personal Life
Fentlama is a trans woman. She transitioned at the age of 18.

Fentlama lives with Þana Admjarec, but they are unmarried.
