The **Xíte Rebellion** was a rebellion against the Wiþi Empire in Upper Grèsent. It began in 2037 in Ongrèstilsa, and spread to several other cities in Upper Grèsent. The rebellion was decentralised in nature, and did not have a unified leadership. It was quickly suppressed by the Wiþi Empire.

## Background
The Kingdom of Covtle, the predecessor state to the Wiþi Empire, began expanding into Grèsent in 1731 with the conquest of Agrasichas. By 1876, all of Grèsent was controlled by Covtle, either directly or through client states.

In 1984, the Wiþi Empire reorganised Laplimotem teñe ad Grèsent (lit. The external territory of Grèsent), adding the client state of Lèrtsbon to the territory, renamed Laplimotem teñe ad Grèsent igvli (lit. The external territory of Upper Grèsent), and the clients of Sudasichas and Dokagrolis to a new Laplimotem teñe ad Grèsent agvla (lit. The external territory of Lower Grèsent). This reorganisation gave each plimotem teñe a small number of seats in Lapazadapalavi, although these seats are highly outnumbered by seats representing Covtle.
