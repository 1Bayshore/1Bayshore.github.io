The train lurched back and forth as it wound its way through the currently leafless trees of the Cientla mountains. A dusting of snow lay on the ground. Thick black smoke rose from the locomotive and dissipated into the low-lying clouds.

Inside the third carriage from the front, Jetla and Mosile sat next to each other on the forward-facing hardwood seat, with Flac on the reversed seat facing them. Mosile glanced back over from staring out the window to look at Jetla. She sighed.

"I still think it's a mistake," she said quietly.

"Going in like an angry dragon would be a mistake," Jetla said. "We need to be more methodical than that to-"

"No we don't\!" Mosile said. "We already know that she's being held at her family's place. Once we find out where that is, we-"

"What if we're wrong?" Jetla said, getting a bit louder. "We only get one chance to get this right. If we-"

"The longer we take," Mosile said, "the more Cemili suffers. And besides, we're more likely to get caught if-"

"We're *guaranteed* to get caught if we go in the front door," Jetla said. The conductor entered the front of the carriage and began checking and punching tickets. "Is that any better for her than-"

"If we're fast enough," Mosile said, "we'll be out of there before anyone else realises. Walking in the front door is normally easier than-"

"It might be locked\!" Jetla said. She looked uneasily at the rapidly approaching conductor and lowered her voice again. "What do you say then?" 

"Fireball\!" Flac said enthusiastically. Jetla stared nervously at her. "With one fireball, we can-"

"Tickets, please\!" the conductor said to the three of them.

The three of them handed over their tickets. The conductor punched them and handed them back. "Thank you," Jetla said. The conductor moved on.

"Anyways," Flac said, more quietly this time, "a fireball would be perfect for-"

"No\!" Jetla said. "If we light the building on fire, everyone in the city can see what-"

"Jetla," Mosile said, "you're the only one here in favour of crawling around in back alleys while Cemili suffers. Can we please just agree that we're going to move in quickly and get Cemili out before things get worse?"

Jetla sighed. "If Cemili was here, do you really think that's the plan she'd want us to go with?"

"She'll be here sooner with me and Flac's plan," Mosile said.

"Fine," Jetla said.

The train continued to wind its way through the mountains. It passed through a short tunnel and over the Þmata pass. It then wound its way slowly downhill towards Wàmèrà.

The ground was bare by the time the train reached Póɲùùò. It continued through the yellow-green pastures and grazing grounds of upland Wàmèrà. As they approached Ʃàbèè, people wearing dull-coloured clothes riding on the backs of brown horses became visible through the windows.

Jetla, Mosile, and Flac ate an early lunch of spiced meats and bread in the restaurant car. They returned to their seats for the long climb up the mountains to Quərfi. The terrain grew increasingly rocky, and the trees increasingly scraggly. The train then entered a long tunnel, and began to slow down.

As the train emerged from the other end of the tunnel, the three friends looked out the window. Snow fell into the already snow-covered ridgeline of the mountain. Occasional zatr trees poked through the snow, their green needles shimmering. The train over a bridge by a waterfall and onto a plateau, which quickly widened. Tall stone buildings began to appear, with people in flowing grey cloaks on flying carpets gliding through the air.

The train slowed still more and pulled into the station, where it came to a stop. Jetla, Mosile, and Flac got up and made their way out of the train and into the small but spacious station. They walked along the stone wall of the station, observing the clean stone wall.

"Not a lot of flyposting here," Jetla commented.

They continued out through the large doors and into the snowy street. Two flying carpets zoomed by in opposite directions, each carrying people in flowing cloaks. Mosile and Flac took a moment to look around. The two of them fixated on a number of floating buildings tethered above the street to their left.

"Are we going up there?" Flac asked.

"We're supposed to be going to the top of Xəmar vrə Həli," Jetla said.

"What does that mean?" Mosile asked.

"Something like the Tower of Stone," Jetla said.

Flac looked around. A cloaked person was walking out of the station. "Excuse me," Flac said to the cloaked person, "could you help us find the Tower of Stone?"

The cloaked person walked around Flac as if she was a stone pillar. He then walked a short distance down the street, before lifting his left arm slightly. An empty carpet flew in from above and landed on the ground in front of him. He sat down on the carpet and grabbed a hold of the sides. The carpet then flew off towards the floating buildings. Flac looked baffled.

"Maybe you can try Quərfi next time?" Flac asked Jetla.

"The Quərfi are not known for their friendliness," Jetla said.

"Why?" Flac asked. "Cemili seems friendly enough."

Mosile's eyes glimmered. "Cemili would know more than me," she said, "but basically, one cold winter day long ago, a woman named Ʃənə Xō was weaving a ceremonial carpet. She wanted to make it smoother, so she added a thread of what we now know as Quərfi silk. But to her great surprise, the carpet, when lifted off the loom, began to float in midair. She experimented with it and discovered that-"

"Just a second, Mosile," Jetla said. She stepped towards another cloaked person exiting the station and said something in Quərfi to her. The woman raised her head slightly, said a few words back, and walked away. Jetla turned back to the others.

"She said to request a carpet, I think," Jetla said.

Everyone watched as the cloaked woman raised her left hand slightly and an empty carpet flew in from above. Like the last person, she sat down on the carpet and grabbed a hold of the sides. The carpet once again flew off towards the floating buildings.

Jetla ran over towards the spot where the last two people had gotten onto flying carpets. The others followed close behind. She raised her hand slightly. To her great confusion, a carpet with a cloaked person on it flew in from above. He looked up at Jetla and spoke in broken Adcovtle.

"Where do you wish to go?" he asked.

"The three of us would like to travel to the top of Xəmar vrə Həli," Jetla said.

The man's expression seemed to become even more serious than before. "The Minister of Defense does not take tourists," he said.

"We're not looking for the Minister of Defense," Jetla said. "We're looking for Gno Kəʒgan."

The man scowled. "The Minister of Defense should be addressed with his title," he said.

Jetla looked at Mosile and Flac for a second, before turning back to the man and saying, "We have a personal invitation."

The man narrowed his eyes slightly. "500 drir," he said. "We leave shortly."

Jetla handed the man 500 drir. Then Jetla, Mosile, and Flac all sat down on the back of the carpet and grabbed a hold of it. The cloaked man grabbed the side and suddenly the carpet flew off into the air. The three friends held on tightly as a heavy breeze blew against them. They all looked around as they zoomed past other flying carpets in the air and up towards the tops of stone towers and floating buildings. Flac giggled as they got higher off the ground.

"This is awesome\!" she said.

They slowed down and landed on a small platform near the top of one of the stone towers. The cloaked man indicated to a door to their left, surrounded by a shimmering green cloth. "There," he said.

Jetla, Mosile, and Flac stood up and got off the flying carpet. They walked over towards the door. Mosile rested her hand on the hilt of her sword. Flac knocked on the door.

After a moment the door opened, giving Jetla, Mosile, and Flac a glimpse of a stone chamber well lit by lamps. Someone in a cloak on the other side stared at Flac for a short moment. "Who are you?" he asked in Adcovtle, with a clear Quərfi accent.

"We demand to see Cemili \- I mean Gnosə Kəʒgan \- at once," Flac said.

"Demand not accepted," the man in the cloak said, and began to close the door.

Flac and Mosile stepped forward to stop the door from closing, when suddenly someone behind the man in the cloak said something in Quərfi. The man in the cloak suddenly reopened the door. A woman in a cloak was now standing behind the man who had opened the door. "My apologies," she said in Adcovtle. "I've been hoping to see you. Do come in."

"We demand to see Gnosə Kəʒgan," Flac said.

"I'm sure that can be arranged," the woman said. "Do come in."

Flac glanced back at the others before stepping through the door. Mosile and Jetla followed. The woman smiled slightly.

"This isn't what I expected at all," Mosile whispered to Jetla.

"Me neither," Jetla whispered back. "Be prepared for the worst."

"I am," Mosile whispered, tightening her grip on the hilt of her sword.
