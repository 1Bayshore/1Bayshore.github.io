**La njomê asd la âstawitse sênja la pflâcerêteme** (modern adcovtle: lañome ad latawiþ ot laflacretem) (lit. the group of snow over fire), better known as **latawiþ seña laflac** (lit. snow over flame), was a pacifist religious group. The group originated in Covtle in opposition to the 1867 war with Ongrèsent. At its peak in 1886 it claimed over 28000 members. It was persecuted in Covtle throughout its entire existence, with many of its members leaving Covtle for Dokagrolis and Wàmèrà. Multiple schisms occurred throughout the group's existence, with a final schism over the status of Tlifa Advlor as Valreon in 2038 resulting in Latawiþ seña laflac splitting into two new groups, Valreon ad lapegar (lit. messiah of peace) and Tepeclaco (lit. the unarmed).
## History
La njomê asd la âstawitse sênja la pflâcerêteme was founded by Ofené Adatagli in 1869. Ofené Adatagli was a gemstone merchant in Paltlon at the time. Early meetings were held secret in an abandoned warehouse near the docks. These meetings began and concluded with displays of magic, but were centred around Ofené's speeches opposing the war.

Similar meetings spread to several other locations, and several other cities. As the movement grew, it began to expand beyond being solely an anti-war movement and take positions on other issues. On 17 soli 1870, Ofené circulated a secret pamphlet detailing what would come to be known as the Fundamental Principles. These principles formed the basis of the beliefs of members of Latawiþ seña laflac.

On 9 pavi 1870, Ofené was arrested for refusal to produce gemstone-based explosives for the war. He was sentenced to 38 years in prison, but died after only 6.

Following Ofené's arrest, membership increased to an estimated 7000 members. A leadership council was set up, consisting of one member from each city or village with a presence of the group. On 13 gerongoni 1870, Latawiþ seña laflac was officially declared illegal and a number of leaders were arrested. This led to the first schism, with a group called Teviavlado (lit. the butterflies) choosing self-exile in Wàmèrà, while the majority of the members stayed in Covtle.

Membership stagnated after the declaration of illegality, but began to grow again in 1874. An estimated 3300 former soldiers joined the group after the end of the war in 1876. From 1876 to 1886 Latawiþ seña laflac grew to an estimated 28000 members.

On 1 pecatri 1888 a disagreement between the groups on whether to accept the Covtle-appointed government of Grèsent resulted in another schism, with those opposed to recognition forming a group called Latawiþ þo Grèsent (lit. snow for Grèsent). After this membership in both groups declined, and by 1900 Latawiþ seña laflac was estimated to have only 9000 members.

In the years of peace between 1900 and the beginning of the Wàmèri war in 2019, Latawiþ seña laflac began to become increasingly suspicious of new technology. During this time they also explicitly rejected the reforms of Lañome ad lini, and continued to use the Old Adcovtle spellings. The number of members remained roughly stable, even as the group became somewhat tolerated, if not legalised.

Membership of Latawiþ seña laflac increased again with the onset of the Wàmèrì war in 2019. In 2022 the group was estimated to have about 16000 members, the most since the 1800s.

On 9 soli 2038, one year after Tlifa Advlor declared herself to be Valreon, a meeting was held to decide the legitimacy of her claim. The meeting resulted in the final schism of the group, with roughly half of the members forming Valreon ad lapegar (lit. messiah of peace) and the other half forming Tepeclaco (lit. the unarmed).
## Beliefs
### Fundamental Principles
Followers of Latawiþ seña laflac believed the following fundamental principles, as laid out in the pamphlet from Ofené:
Baðatrepava taught his followers to accept their fate, even when in exile, not to make war
Magic should be used for the benefit of humanity
Work should only be completed if it benefits humanity
Following Baðatrepava's teachings takes priority over following orders
True followers of Baðatrepava should only associate with other true followers
### Other Beliefs
Members of Latawiþ seña laflac also believed in the importance of studying Baðatrepava's writings, and the importance of keeping one's word. They were known to be suspicious of, if not entirely hostile to, new technologies. They rejected the reforms of Lañome ad lini, and continued to use the Old Adcovtle spellings.
## Descendent Groups
### Teviavlado
The Teviavlado group split on 14 gerongoni 1870. They reject the legitimacy of the government of Covtle, believing that Oneaþ was the last legitimate leader of the Followers of Baðatrepava, and believe that the Followers of Baðatrepava should always be in exile. They are estimated to number about 1000 members, almost entirely in Wàmèrà.
### Latawiþ þo Grèsent
Latawiþ þo Grèsent split on 1 pecatri 1888. They reject the rule of Covtle over any of Grèsent, considering it to be against Ofené's Principles. They have significant participation from Grèstilsans. They are estimated to number about 2400 members, almost entirely in Dokagrolis.
### Valreon ad lapegar
Valreon ad lapegar split on 9 soli 2038. They believe that Tlifa Advlor is Valreon, or the prophesied one by Baðatrepava, and that she will restore peace to the world. They are estimated to number about 5000 members, mostly across Covtle.
### Tepeclado
Tepeclado split on 9 soli 2038. They believe that Valreon will arrive soon, but that Tlifa Advlor is a fraud and not the prophesied one. They are estimated to number about 7000 members, and are spread across Covtle, Lower Grèsent, and Wàmèra.
