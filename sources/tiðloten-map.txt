I've been working on a map of my fictional continent for a while. The continent has several names in the many languages that are spoken there, but it is called Tiðloten in the language of the largest power on the continent, and so that is the name that is used here. This power, the Wiþi Empire, is controlled by Covtle and controls all of the areas in orange. This is a political map of the continent, although it also includes major rivers.
