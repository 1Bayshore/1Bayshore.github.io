*(This is the first installment of a new story called The Plusamben Fellowship that will be posted every Sunday. Enjoy\!)*

Jetla walked into the busy pub, looking around for her friends. The pub felt even smaller than normal. The dim light of glowing rubies above the tables gave a feeling of warmth. People were crowded around the cheap wooden tables, enjoying their drinks and food.

The waiter, Caþa, smiled as he saw Jetla. "They're over by the east window," he said.

Jetla crossed the stone floor, weaving between the crowded tables towards the window. She spotted her friends Mosile and Flac sitting at one of the tables, mugs of ale in front of them. Jetla sat down in one of the two open chairs. "Sorry I'm late," she said.

Mosile took a sip of ale. "Now Jetla, do *you* know where Cemili is?" she asked.

"No," Jetla said. "I haven't seen her since this time last week."

"I'm really worried about her," Mosile said.

"Yeah," Jetla said. She checked her watch. "It's 55 minutes after she normally gets here."

"She was so excited about her paper in the History of Covtle class," Mosile said. "But she wasn't there this week."

"That's really not like her," Jetla said.

"I was hoping to show her my new shirt," Mosile said. "Do you think she'll like it?"

"She does like purple," Jetla said.

"So you're not taking me up on my offer to turn it orange?" Flac asked.

Jetla and Mosile laughed. "I think I'll stick with purple, thanks," Mosile said.

"How were your classes this week, Flac?" Jetla asked.

"Boring," Flac said. She took a sip of ale. "I mean, we're still talking about how to make precise gemstone layouts. I want to be a wizard, not sit around discussing magic miniaturisation every day\!"

"Fair," Jetla said. "How about you, Mosile?"

"Espa is no longer undefeated in sword fighting," Mosile said.

"Congratulations\!" Jetla said.

"Perhaps he'll reconsider challenging classmates to random sword fights," Flac said. Jetla and Mosile laughed.

Jetla checked her watch. "Cemili was supposed to be here an hour ago," she said. "Do you think we should go check on her?"

"I'm still very worried about her," Mosile said. "We should make sure she's okay."

The three of them got up from the table and navigated back through the other tables towards the door. Caþa nodded as they headed out. Mosile pushed open the heavy wooden door and they went out into the square.

Jetla, Mosile, and Flac hurried through the square, ignoring several attempts to sell them everything from Wàmèrìzé spice to brightly coloured cloth to a "gem of mind calming", whatever that was. They wound their way through the busy streets until they reached the plain stone building where Cemili lived. They headed up the staircase to Cemili's door and knocked. There was no answer.

"I hope we're not disturbing her," Mosile said.

Mosile looked around, feeling uneasy about something. The stairway was dim, and the stone walls cold. She looked down at the floor and gasped. There was a dark spot on the floor right next to the door.

"Is that…is that what I think it is?" she said, pointing to the dark spot.

"By Baðatrepava himself\!" Flac said as she threw open the door into the flat.

The floor inside the flat was smeared with dried blood. A few broken dishes were scattered on the floor next to an overturned chair.

"Cemili\!" Mosile called out. Tears began to run down her face as she ran into the flat. "Cemili, where are you?"

Jetla and Flac hurried in behind Mosile. Flac ran around the flat, checking every corner of both rooms. Mosile looked in the closet. Jetla picked up a piece of cloth from the floor. Cemili was nowhere to be found.

"She can't be…" Mosile said, beginning to cry harder. "There's no way…"

"I don't think she is," Jetla said.

"Then where is she?" Mosile asked.

"She's been carried off," Jetla said. She pointed to the streak of dried blood on the floor leading from the overturned chair to the door. "She was sitting at the table when someone broke in and tried to kidnap her. She tried to fight them off, and got hurt in the process. The attacker dragged her across the floor, leaving this smear, and out the door."

Flac ran out the door, and down the stairs. The others followed close behind. "Here's more," she said. "And more," she said as she continued towards the exterior door. "Here's some right at the door."

Flac flung open the exterior door and looked out into the busy street. Jetla, Mosile, and Flac left the building, looking for more bloodstains on the ground. Mud filled the spaces between the worn-down cobblestones on the street. It was hard to see in the dark.

"Now what?" Mosile asked. "There's nothing else to follow. She's gone, and-"

Jetla held up the piece of cloth that she'd picked up earlier. "I found this in the flat," she said.

"Quərfi silk?" Mosile said. "You mean…"

"We need to get to Quərfi now\!" Flac said.

"The next train leaves at Cavle's hour and 22 tomorrow," Jetla said. "We should meet an hour beforehand at the station."

"We can't fail this," Mosile said.

"We won't," Flac said.
