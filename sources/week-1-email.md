Hello! Thanks to everyone who signed up for email updates. I've written another week of The Plusameben Fellowship (in case you missed the first entry, you can find it [here](https://1bayshore.github.io/2025/2/2/1-cemili-is-gone.html)). [**Here's this week's entry.**](https://1bayshore.github.io/2025/2/9/2-the-qu%C9%99rfi-city-express.html)

Thanks again for your interest!
