## Childhood in Quərfi
Jetla Acleð (not her original name) was born on 5 vlori 2019 in Quərfi. Her birth was announced via a royal proclamation. According to Quərfi tradition, she slept on a floating bed and was not allowed to touch the ground for the first hundred days after her birth.

Jetla has described her childhood as "lonely". She was not allowed outside the palace except for during official events. She was tutored by Xənē Ʒəli in politics, history, magic, and religion. In an interview with Lelvlai ad Mangátle (lit. The Mangátle Star), Jetla stated that Xənē denied her food and breaks during her 12-hour daily lessons.

At the age of 14, after the death of her uncle Kəquaʒ, Jetla was given the title of  Deinoiʔi vrə Xəmar vrə Həri (lit. Prince of Sky Tower). She used her new title to fire her tutor Xənē, which caused controversy within the palace but was agreed to by her father King Gno Gəʒe, on the condition that she request a new tutor. She requested Xənha, a famous author and polyglot. This was seen as an unconventional choice, but her father agreed to it.

While Jetla was initially praised for her diligence in her work, she was later accused of neglecting her duties in Xəmar vrə Həri (lit. Sky Tower) in favour of studying languages with Xənha. In his trial, Xənha stated that Jetla had expressed increasing interest in Adcovtle over other languages by age 17.

## Escape from Quərfi
On the morning of 15 seci 2039, Jetla was reported missing from her quarters by a servant bringing her breakfast. The city was searched, and Jetla was declared missing.
